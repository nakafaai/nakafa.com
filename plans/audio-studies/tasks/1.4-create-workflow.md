# Task 1.4: Audio Studies Workflow

## Goal
Document the workflow orchestration pattern for audio generation.

## Note
The workflow is orchestrated directly through mutations calling actions sequentially:

1. `request` mutation (public) calls:
   - `upsert` mutation to create record
   - `generateScript` action to start generation

2. `generateScript` action (internal) calls:
   - AI to generate script
   - `saveScript` mutation to save script

3. `saveScript` mutation (internal) calls:
   - `generateSpeech` action to generate audio

4. `generateSpeech` action (internal) calls:
   - ElevenLabs API
   - `saveAudio` mutation to save audio file

This pattern eliminates the need for a separate workflow file while maintaining proper separation of concerns.

## Files
- `packages/backend/convex/audioStudies/mutations.ts` - Contains orchestration logic
- `packages/backend/convex/audioStudies/actions.ts` - Contains AI generation

## Commands
```bash
pnpm typecheck
