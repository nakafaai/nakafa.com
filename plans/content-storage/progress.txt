## Status: Planning Complete

---

[2025-01-24 00:00] Planning phase completed

Key decisions:
- Full normalization approach chosen
- Shared authors table with N:M join
- Normalized article references (can exceed 5-10 limit)
- Normalized exercise choices (each gets _id for tracking)
- Date stored as number (epoch millis) for sorting

Files planned:
- packages/backend/convex/lib/contentValidators.ts
- packages/backend/convex/authors/schema.ts
- packages/backend/convex/articleContents/schema.ts
- packages/backend/convex/subjectContents/schema.ts
- packages/backend/convex/exerciseContents/schema.ts
- packages/backend/convex/schema.ts (update)

Tables to create (7):
1. authors
2. contentAuthors
3. articleContents
4. articleReferences
5. subjectContents
6. exerciseContents
7. exerciseChoices

Blockers/notes:
- Ready for implementation
- Run `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck` after each task
