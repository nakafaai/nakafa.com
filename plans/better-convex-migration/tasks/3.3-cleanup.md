# Task 3.3: Cleanup

## Goal

Remove old component after 1 week stability.

## Wait 1 Week

Don't proceed until:
- 1 week since production deploy
- No critical issues
- No rollback needed
- Team agrees it's safe

## Cleanup Steps

1. **Delete component directory**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf packages/backend/convex/betterAuth
   ```

2. **Verify app works**:
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @repo/backend typecheck
   convex dev
   ```

3. **Update docs**:
   - Remove references to component
   - Update architecture docs
   - Update onboarding

## Component Tables

The component tables in Convex will still exist. You can delete them manually later if desired.

## Verification

- [ ] 1 week stability passed
- [ ] Directory deleted
- [ ] App works without component
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Migration Complete!

You've successfully migrated from `@convex-dev/better-auth` to `better-convex`.
