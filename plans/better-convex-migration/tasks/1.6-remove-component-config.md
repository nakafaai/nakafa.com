# Task 1.6: Remove Component Config

## Goal

Remove betterAuth component from convex.config.ts.

## Implementation

Update `packages/backend/convex/convex.config.ts`:

```typescript
import migrations from "@convex-dev/migrations/convex.config";
import resend from "@convex-dev/resend/convex.config.js";
import workflow from "@convex-dev/workflow/convex.config.js";
import { defineApp } from "convex/server";

const app = defineApp();
// REMOVED: app.use(betterAuth);
app.use(migrations);
app.use(workflow);
app.use(resend);

export default app;
```

## Keep Component Directory

Don't delete `packages/backend/convex/betterAuth/` yet - we need it for:
1. Data migration (reading from component tables)
2. Rollback capability

Delete it in Task 3.4 after production is stable.

## Verification

- [ ] Component removed from config
- [ ] Other components still work
- [ ] TypeScript compiles

## Next
