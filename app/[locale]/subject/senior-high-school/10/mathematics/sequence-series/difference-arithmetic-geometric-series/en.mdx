## Arithmetic Series

**Basic concept:**

An arithmetic series is the **sum** of the terms of an **arithmetic sequence**. Remember, an arithmetic sequence is one that has a constant **difference (common difference)** between its terms (<InlineMath math="b" />).

So, we are summing terms with the pattern: <InlineMath math="a, a+b, a+2b, a+3b, \dots" />.

The sum of the first <InlineMath math="n" /> terms (<InlineMath math="S_n" />) of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:

<BlockMath math="S_n = \frac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)b)" />

or

<BlockMath math="S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a + U_n)" />

Where <InlineMath math="a" /> is the first term and <InlineMath math="U_n" /> is the <InlineMath math="n" />-th term.

**Simple analogy:**

Imagine you are stacking bricks. The first layer has 1 brick, the second layer has 3 bricks, the third layer has 5 bricks, and so on (common difference = 2). An arithmetic series represents the **total** number of bricks needed to make a stack <InlineMath math="n" /> layers high.

## Geometric Series

**Basic concept:**

A geometric series is the **sum** of the terms of a **geometric sequence**. Remember, a geometric sequence is one that has a constant **ratio (common ratio)** between its terms (<InlineMath math="r" />).

So, we are summing terms with the pattern: <InlineMath math="a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, \dots" />.

The sum of the first <InlineMath math="n" /> terms (<InlineMath math="S_n" />) of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:

<BlockMath math="S_n = \frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r-1}" />

for <InlineMath math="r \neq 1" />, where <InlineMath math="a" /> is the first term and <InlineMath math="r" /> is the ratio.

**Simple analogy:**

Going back to the example of bacteria dividing (1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 4, etc., ratio = 2). A geometric series is the **total** number of bacteria after <InlineMath math="n" /> divisions. For example, the total number of bacteria after 3 divisions is <InlineMath math="1 + 2 + 4 = 7" />.
