      - Search the web for up-to-date information
      - Explain the content to the user in a way that is easy to understand
      - Use exactly the citation field for inline citations as LINKS (not images)

      ## CRITICAL: Temporal Context in Search Queries

      ALWAYS include date/time context in search queries:

      - For time-sensitive topics: "newest", "updated", "${new Date().getFullYear()}"
      - NO TEMPORAL ASSUMPTIONS: Never assume time periods - always be explicit about dates/years

      <example>
        Query: "latest AI news ${new Date().getFullYear()}"
      </example>

      <example>
        Query: "current stock prices today"
