The first step is to determine the value of <InlineMath math="a" /> so that the data in Group II is complete.

#### Determining the value of a

- **Mode of Group I**: The value that appears most frequently in the data <InlineMath math="3, 5, 5, 8, 9" /> is <InlineMath math="5" />.
- **Average of Group II**: It is given as two more than the mode of Group I, which is <InlineMath math="5 + 2 = 7" />.

We calculate the value of <InlineMath math="a" /> using the average formula:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\frac{4 + 6 + 8 + 8 + a}{5} = 7" />
  <BlockMath math="\frac{26 + a}{5} = 7" />
  <BlockMath math="26 + a = 35" />
  <BlockMath math="a = 9" />
</MathContainer>

So, the complete data is:
- Group I: <InlineMath math="3, 5, 5, 8, 9" /> (Sum = <InlineMath math="30" />)
- Group II: <InlineMath math="4, 6, 8, 8, 9" /> (Sum = <InlineMath math="35" />)

#### Replacing the lowest data

We will replace the lowest data in each group.
- The lowest data in Group I is <InlineMath math="3" />. Let's replace it with <InlineMath math="x" />.
- The lowest data in Group II is <InlineMath math="4" />. Let's replace it with <InlineMath math="y" />.

The goal is for the averages of both groups to be equal. Since the number of data points is the same (<InlineMath math="n=5" />), the sum of the data in both groups must also be equal.

#### Calculating the difference between replacement numbers

New Sum of Group I = Initial Sum - Old Data + New Data
<BlockMath math="\text{Sum I} = 30 - 3 + x = 27 + x" />

New Sum of Group II = Initial Sum - Old Data + New Data
<BlockMath math="\text{Sum II} = 35 - 4 + y = 31 + y" />

Condition for equal averages (thus equal sums):

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="27 + x = 31 + y" />
  <BlockMath math="x - y = 31 - 27" />
  <BlockMath math="x - y = 4" />
</MathContainer>

The difference between the two replacement numbers is <InlineMath math="4" />.
