We are asked to find the value of <InlineMath math="a" /> based on information about the average of Group II and the mode of Group I.

#### Determining the Mode of Group I

Data for Group I: <InlineMath math="3, 5, 5, 8, 9" />.

The mode is the value that appears most frequently.
From the data, the value <InlineMath math="5" /> appears 2 times, while other values appear only once.

So, Mode of Group I <InlineMath math="= 5" />.

#### Determining the Average of Group II

It is given that the average of Group II is **two more than the mode of Group I**.

<BlockMath math="\text{Average of Group II} = \text{Mode of Group I} + 2" />
<BlockMath math="\text{Average of Group II} = 5 + 2 = 7" />

#### Finding the Value of <InlineMath math="a" />

The average formula is the sum of all data divided by the number of data points.
Data for Group II: <InlineMath math="4, 6, 8, 8, a" />.
There are 5 data points.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Average} = \frac{4 + 6 + 8 + 8 + a}{5}" />
  <BlockMath math="7 = \frac{26 + a}{5}" />
</MathContainer>

Multiply both sides by 5:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="7 \times 5 = 26 + a" />
  <BlockMath math="35 = 26 + a" />
</MathContainer>

Move 26 to the left side:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="a = 35 - 26" />
  <BlockMath math="a = 9" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the value of <InlineMath math="a" /> is <InlineMath math="9" />.
