The first step is to solve the given linear inequality in one variable.

Inequality:

<BlockMath math="5a - 7 \leq 3a + 9" />

Group the terms containing the variable <InlineMath math="a" /> on the left side and the constants on the right side:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="5a - 3a \leq 9 + 7" />
  <BlockMath math="2a \leq 16" />
</MathContainer>

Divide both sides by <InlineMath math="2" />:

<BlockMath math="a \leq 8" />

It is given that <InlineMath math="a" /> is an **integer** **greater than 7** (<InlineMath math="a > 7" />).

So we are looking for an integer that satisfies both of the following conditions:
1. <InlineMath math="a \leq 8" />
2. <InlineMath math="a > 7" />

This means <InlineMath math="7 < a \leq 8" />.

The only integer that satisfies this interval is:

<BlockMath math="a = 8" />

Thus, the value of <InlineMath math="a" /> is <InlineMath math="8" />.
