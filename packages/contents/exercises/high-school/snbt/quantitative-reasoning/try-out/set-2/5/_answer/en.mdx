The first step is to find the value of <InlineMath math="a" /> by summing up all students and equating it to the known total students, which is <InlineMath math="150" />.

#### Calculating the Value of <InlineMath math="a" />

The total number of students is the sum of students from all subjects in all classes:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = (2a + 10 + 20) + (5 + 15 + 3a) + (15 + 10 + 25)" />
  <BlockMath math="150 = 2a + 30 + 20 + 3a + 50" />
  <BlockMath math="150 = 5a + 100" />
</MathContainer>

Solve the equation:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="5a = 150 - 100" />
  <BlockMath math="5a = 50" />
  <BlockMath math="a = 10" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating Total Social Studies Students

Now we calculate the number of students who like Social Studies (IPS):

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Social Studies} = 20 + 3a + 25" />
  <BlockMath math="= 45 + 3(10)" />
  <BlockMath math="= 45 + 30" />
  <BlockMath math="= 75" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating Quantity <InlineMath math="P" />

Quantity <InlineMath math="P" /> is the percentage of total students with Social Studies as their favorite subject out of the total students:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P = \frac{\text{Total Social Studies}}{\text{Total Students}} \times 100\%" />
  <BlockMath math="P = \frac{75}{150} \times 100\%" />
  <BlockMath math="P = 50\%" />
</MathContainer>

#### Comparing <InlineMath math="P" /> and <InlineMath math="Q" />

Given <InlineMath math="Q = 50\%" />.

Thus:
<BlockMath math="50\% = 50\% \Rightarrow P = Q" />
