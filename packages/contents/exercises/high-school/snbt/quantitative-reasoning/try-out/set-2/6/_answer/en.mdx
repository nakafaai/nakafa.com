To form a distinct four-digit odd number from the digits <InlineMath math="1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6" />, we can use the filling slots method.

There are <InlineMath math="4" /> digit positions: Thousands, Hundreds, Tens, and Units.

#### Step 1: Filling the Units Position

For the number to be odd, the units digit must be an odd number. From the available digits (<InlineMath math="1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6" />), the odd numbers are <InlineMath math="1, 3, 5" />.

So, there are **<InlineMath math="3" />** choices for the units position.

#### Step 2: Filling the Thousands Position

After one digit is used for the units position, there are <InlineMath math="6 - 1 = 5" /> digits remaining for the thousands position (since the digits must be distinct).

So, there are **<InlineMath math="5" />** choices for the thousands position.

#### Step 3: Filling the Hundreds Position

After two digits are used (for units and thousands), there are <InlineMath math="6 - 2 = 4" /> digits remaining.

So, there are **<InlineMath math="4" />** choices for the hundreds position.

#### Step 4: Filling the Tens Position

After three digits are used, there are <InlineMath math="6 - 3 = 3" /> digits remaining.

So, there are **<InlineMath math="3" />** choices for the tens position.

#### Total Calculation

The number of numbers that can be formed is the product of the number of choices for each position:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 3" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = 180" />
</MathContainer>

So, there are <InlineMath math="180" /> numbers that can be formed.
