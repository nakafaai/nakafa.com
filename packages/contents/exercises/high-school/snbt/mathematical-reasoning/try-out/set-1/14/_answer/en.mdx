We will use the concept of inverse proportion to solve this problem. The more workers there are, the shorter the time required, and vice versa.

#### Calculating Total Workload

The total project workload can be expressed in "man-days":

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Workload} = \text{Number of Workers} \times \text{Time}" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Workload} = 80 \times 50 = 4,000 \text{ man-days}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating Time with New Workers

If the number of workers is reduced to 64, the time required (<InlineMath math="t" />) is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="64 \times t = 4,000" />
  <BlockMath math="t = \frac{4,000}{64}" />
</MathContainer>

We calculate the division result:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="t = \frac{1,000}{16} = \frac{500}{8} = \frac{125}{2} = 62.5 \text{ days}" />
</MathContainer>

Since the work takes <InlineMath math="62.5" /> days, it means the work will be completed in the middle of the 63rd day. So, the time required to complete the project is **63 days**.
