We will use the concept of inverse proportion to determine the total number of workers needed, then calculate the difference with the initial number of workers.

#### Calculating Total Workload

The total project workload is constant, which is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Workload} = \text{Initial Workers} \times \text{Initial Time}" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Workload} = 80 \times 50 = 4,000 \text{ man-days}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating Required Number of Workers

If the completion time is accelerated to 40 days, the number of workers required (<InlineMath math="P" />) is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P \times 40 = 4,000" />
  <BlockMath math="P = \frac{4,000}{40}" />
  <BlockMath math="P = 100 \text{ people}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating Additional Workers

The existing number of workers is 80. Thus, the additional workers needed are:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Additional} = \text{Required Workers} - \text{Initial Workers}" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Additional} = 100 - 80 = 20 \text{ people}" />
</MathContainer>

So, the number of additional workers needed is **20 people**.
