We will calculate the increase in sales based on the price reduction, then add it to the initial sales.

#### Price Reduction Analysis

Initial price per cup: <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}12,000.00" />.
New price per cup: <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}9,000.00" />.

Price reduction that occurred:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Reduction} = 12,000 - 9,000 = \text{Rp}3,000.00" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating Sales Increase

It is known that for every <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}1,000.00" /> decrease, sales increase by 20 cups.
Number of price reduction multiples:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="k = \frac{3,000}{1,000} = 3 \text{ times}" />
</MathContainer>

So, the additional sales are:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Additional} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cups}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating Total Sales

Initial sales were 200 cups.
Total sales after price reduction:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = \text{Initial} + \text{Additional}" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ cups}" />
</MathContainer>

So, the number of iced coffees sold per day is 260 cups.
