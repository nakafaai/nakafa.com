A cuboid-shaped cardboard box has a base perimeter of <InlineMath math="6x \text{ cm}" /> and a height of <InlineMath math="\left(5 - \frac{1}{3}x\right) \text{ cm}" /> where <InlineMath math="x" /> is a real number.

If the base of the box is rectangular with a width of <InlineMath math="(4x - 5) \text{ cm}" /> and <InlineMath math="A" /> is the set containing all real numbers <InlineMath math="x" /> that satisfy the dimensions of the cuboid, the maximum surface area of the box is ... <InlineMath math="\text{cm}^2" />.
