We will calculate the total cost required by Rani, which consists of the purchase price of the seedling packages and the cost of fertilizer for the land used.

#### Determining the Number of Seedlings

Rani buys 2 packages of fruit seedlings. Each package contains 2 strawberry seedlings, 1 orange seedling, and 4 mango seedlings. Thus, the total seedlings obtained from 2 packages are:

- Strawberry: <InlineMath math="2 \times 2 = 4" /> seedlings.
- Orange: <InlineMath math="2 \times 1 = 2" /> seedlings.
- Mango: <InlineMath math="2 \times 4 = 8" /> seedlings.

#### Calculating the Required Land Area

We calculate the land area for each type of seedling:

**Strawberry Seedlings**

The land size for one strawberry seedling is <InlineMath math="10 \text{ cm} \times 5 \text{ cm}" />.

<BlockMath math="L_{\text{strawberry}} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ cm}^2" />

Total area for 4 strawberry seedlings:

<BlockMath math="L_{\text{total strawberry}} = 4 \times 50 = 200 \text{ cm}^2" />

**Orange Seedlings**

The land size for an orange seedling is twice the size of the land for a strawberry seedling. In this context, the length and width dimensions are each doubled (<InlineMath math="20 \text{ cm} \times 10 \text{ cm}" />).

<BlockMath math="L_{\text{orange}} = 20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ cm}^2" />

Total area for 2 orange seedlings:

<BlockMath math="L_{\text{total orange}} = 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ cm}^2" />

**Mango Seedlings**

The land size for one mango seedling is <InlineMath math="5 \text{ cm} \times 2.5 \text{ cm}" />.

<BlockMath math="L_{\text{mango}} = 5 \times 2.5 = 12.5 \text{ cm}^2" />

Total area for 8 mango seedlings:

<BlockMath math="L_{\text{total mango}} = 8 \times 12.5 = 100 \text{ cm}^2" />

**Total Land Area**

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="L_{\text{total}} = 200 + 400 + 100" />
  <BlockMath math="L_{\text{total}} = 700 \text{ cm}^2" />
</MathContainer>

We convert the area unit to square meters (<InlineMath math="1 \text{ m}^2 = 10,000 \text{ cm}^2" />):

<BlockMath math="L_{\text{total}} = \frac{700}{10,000} = 0.07 \text{ m}^2" />

#### Calculating Total Cost

**Seed Cost**

The price of 1 package is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}45,000.00" />. For 2 packages:

<BlockMath math="\text{Seed Cost} = 2 \times 45,000 = \text{Rp}90,000.00" />

**Fertilizer Cost**

The price of fertilizer is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}100,000.00/\text{m}^2" />. For land with an area of <InlineMath math="0.07 \text{ m}^2" />:

<BlockMath math="\text{Fertilizer Cost} = 0.07 \times 100,000 = \text{Rp}7,000.00" />

**Total Expenditure**

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = 90,000 + 7,000" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = 97,000" />
</MathContainer>

So, the amount of money Rani has to spend is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}97,000.00" />.
