We will calculate the combined work rate of Kardi and Anton, then determine the time needed to complete the total work.

#### Calculating Combined Work Rate

Work rate of each person per day:
- Kardi: <InlineMath math="10" /> walls/day.
- Anton: <InlineMath math="6" /> walls/day.

If they work together, their combined rate is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Rate} = \text{Kardi's Rate} + \text{Anton's Rate}" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Rate} = 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ walls/day}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating Completion Time

The total work to be completed is 56 walls. The time required (<InlineMath math="t" />) can be calculated by dividing the total work by the combined rate.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="t = \frac{\text{Total Walls}}{\text{Total Rate}}" />
  <BlockMath math="t = \frac{56}{16}" />
</MathContainer>

We simplify the fraction:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="t = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \text{ days}" />
</MathContainer>

So, the time required for both of them is <InlineMath math="3.5" /> days.
