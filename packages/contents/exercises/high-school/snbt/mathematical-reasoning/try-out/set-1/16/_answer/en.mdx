We will first calculate the average mass of Belle's apples, then use the relationship between Ferdian's and Belle's averages to find the value of <InlineMath math="x" />.

#### Calculating Average Mass of Belle's Apples

The masses of apples collected by Belle are 180, 175, 162, 154, 161, and 170.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\bar{x}_{\text{Belle}} = \frac{180 + 175 + 162 + 154 + 161 + 170}{6}" />
  <BlockMath math="\bar{x}_{\text{Belle}} = \frac{1,002}{6} = 167" />
</MathContainer>

The average mass of Belle's apples is 167 grams.

#### Determining Average Mass of Ferdian's Apples

It is known that Ferdian's average apple mass is 3 grams greater than Belle's.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\bar{x}_{\text{Ferdian}} = \bar{x}_{\text{Belle}} + 3" />
  <BlockMath math="\bar{x}_{\text{Ferdian}} = 167 + 3 = 170" />
</MathContainer>

#### Finding the Value of <InlineMath math="x" />

The masses of apples collected by Ferdian are 157, 163, 182, 171, 167, and <InlineMath math="x" />. Their average is 170.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\bar{x}_{\text{Ferdian}} = \frac{157 + 163 + 182 + 171 + 167 + x}{6}" />
  <BlockMath math="170 = \frac{840 + x}{6}" />
</MathContainer>

Multiply both sides by 6:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="170 \times 6 = 840 + x" />
  <BlockMath math="1,020 = 840 + x" />
  <BlockMath math="x = 1,020 - 840" />
  <BlockMath math="x = 180" />
</MathContainer>

So, the value of <InlineMath math="x" /> is 180.
