We will calculate the total cost to be paid through this special installment scheme and compare it with the initial price of the laptop.

#### Installment Pattern

The installments paid form a decreasing arithmetic sequence:
- First installment (<InlineMath math="a" />) = <InlineMath math="2,000,000" />
- Second installment = <InlineMath math="1,800,000" />
- Difference (<InlineMath math="b" />) = <InlineMath math="1,800,000 - 2,000,000 = -200,000" />

The installments continue until the value approaches zero (the last valid payment cannot be zero rupiah as it adds no cost, so we calculate until the last positive payment).

We determine the number of installments (<InlineMath math="n" />) assuming the last installment (<InlineMath math="U_n" />) is <InlineMath math="200,000" /> (one step before zero):

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="U_n = a + (n-1)b" />
  <BlockMath math="200,000 = 2,000,000 + (n-1)(-200,000)" />
</MathContainer>

We divide both sides by <InlineMath math="200,000" /> to simplify:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="1 = 10 + (n-1)(-1)" />
  <BlockMath math="1 = 10 - n + 1" />
  <BlockMath math="n = 10" />
</MathContainer>

So, there are 10 installments.

#### Calculating Total Payment

The total payment is the sum of the arithmetic series (<InlineMath math="S_{10}" />):

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a + U_n)" />
  <BlockMath math="S_{10} = \frac{10}{2}(2,000,000 + 200,000)" />
  <BlockMath math="S_{10} = 5(2,200,000)" />
  <BlockMath math="S_{10} = 11,000,000" />
</MathContainer>

The total paid is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}11,000,000.00" />.

#### Calculating Price Increase Percentage

The initial price of the series <InlineMath math="B" /> laptop is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}10,000,000.00" />.
Price difference = <InlineMath math="11,000,000 - 10,000,000 = 1,000,000" />.

Percentage price increase:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Percentage} = \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Initial Price}} \times 100\%" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Percentage} = \frac{1,000,000}{10,000,000} \times 100\%" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Percentage} = 10\%" />
</MathContainer>

So, the price of the series <InlineMath math="B" /> laptop is **<InlineMath math="10\%" />** more expensive compared to the initial price.
