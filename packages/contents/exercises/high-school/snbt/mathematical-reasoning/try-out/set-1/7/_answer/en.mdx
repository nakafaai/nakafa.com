We will calculate the work rate of each tractor (the portion of the field that can be plowed in one day) and sum the rates of tractor 1 and 3.

#### Calculating Tractor Work Rates

**Tractor 1:**

Time required = 3 days.
Work rate per day = <InlineMath math="\frac{1}{3}" /> part.

**Tractor 2:**

Time required = <InlineMath math="4 \frac{1}{5} = \frac{21}{5}" /> days.
Work rate per day = <InlineMath math="\frac{1}{\frac{21}{5}} = \frac{5}{21}" /> part.

**Tractor 3:**

Time required = <InlineMath math="3.5 = \frac{7}{2}" /> days.
Work rate per day = <InlineMath math="\frac{1}{\frac{7}{2}} = \frac{2}{7}" /> part.

#### Calculating Combined Tractor 1 and 3

On the first day, only tractors 1 and 3 are used. Thus, the portion of the field that can be plowed is the sum of the work rates of these two tractors.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Portion} = \text{Rate 1} + \text{Rate 3}" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Portion} = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{7}" />
</MathContainer>

We find a common denominator of 21:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Portion} = \frac{7}{21} + \frac{6}{21}" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Portion} = \frac{13}{21}" />
</MathContainer>

So, the portion of the field that can be plowed by both tractors is **<InlineMath math="\frac{13}{21}" />** part.
