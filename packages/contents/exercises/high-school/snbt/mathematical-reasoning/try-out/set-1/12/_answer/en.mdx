We will calculate the weight of the sand first, then use the mixture ratio to determine the required weight of cement.

#### Calculating Sand Weight

Given the volume of sand is <InlineMath math="0.24 \text{ m}^3" /> and the density of sand is <InlineMath math="1,400 \text{ kg/m}^3" />.

<BlockMath math="\text{Sand Weight} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Density}" />

We substitute the values:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Sand Weight} = 0.24 \times 1,400" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Sand Weight} = 336 \text{ kg}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating Cement Weight

Given the mixture ratio of Cement : Sand is <InlineMath math="1 : 5" />. This means for every 5 parts of sand weight, 1 part of cement weight is needed.

<BlockMath math="\text{Cement Weight} = \frac{1}{5} \times \text{Sand Weight}" />

We calculate the cement weight:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Cement Weight} = \frac{1}{5} \times 336" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Cement Weight} = 67.2 \text{ kg}" />
</MathContainer>

So, the amount of cement required is <InlineMath math="67.2 \text{ kg}" />.
