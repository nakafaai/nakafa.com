We will determine the minimum number of installments so that Jojo's monthly payment does not exceed the specified limit.

#### Calculating Price After Discount

Jojo buys a series <InlineMath math="A" /> laptop for <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}15,000,000.00" />. Since there is a <InlineMath math="20\%" /> discount, the price to be paid is:

<BlockMath math="\text{Discounted Price} = (100\% - 20\%) \times 15,000,000" />
<BlockMath math="\text{Discounted Price} = 80\% \times 15,000,000 = 12,000,000" />

The principal loan amount is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}12,000,000.00" />.

#### Determining Interest and Principal Installment

In this anniversary promo, Jojo gets the offer with the lowest installment interest. Based on store rules, the minimum interest obtainable is <InlineMath math="4\%" /> per year (maximum reduction of <InlineMath math="2\%" /> from the base interest of <InlineMath math="6\%" />).

We calculate the monthly interest component:

<BlockMath math="\text{Monthly Interest} = \frac{4\%}{12} \times 12,000,000" />
<BlockMath math="\text{Monthly Interest} = \frac{1}{300} \times 12,000,000 = 40,000" />

The monthly installment amount consists of the principal installment and interest:

<BlockMath math="\text{Installment} = \frac{\text{Loan Principal}}{n} + \text{Monthly Interest}" />

Where <InlineMath math="n" /> is the number of installments.

#### Calculating Minimum Installment Duration

It is known that the monthly installment must not exceed <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}600,000.00" />.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\frac{12,000,000}{n} + 40,000 \le 600,000" />
  <BlockMath math="\frac{12,000,000}{n} \le 560,000" />
  <BlockMath math="n \ge \frac{12,000,000}{560,000}" />
  <BlockMath math="n \ge 21.42" />
</MathContainer>

Since the number of installments must be an integer, Jojo must pay in installments at least **22 times**.
