A cuboid-shaped cardboard box has a base perimeter of <InlineMath math="6x \text{ cm}" /> and a height of <InlineMath math="\left(5 - \frac{1}{3}x\right) \text{ cm}" /> where <InlineMath math="x" /> is a real number.

If the width of the box's base is <InlineMath math="(4x - 5) \text{ cm}" />, the length of the base is ... cm.
