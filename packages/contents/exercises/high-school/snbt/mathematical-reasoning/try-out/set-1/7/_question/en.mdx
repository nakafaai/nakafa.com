A farmer rents 3 types of tractors to plow his rice field. If only tractor 1 is used, it takes <InlineMath math="3" /> days to plow the field. If only tractor 2 is used, it takes <InlineMath math="4 \frac{1}{5}" /> days. Meanwhile, if only tractor 3 is used, it takes <InlineMath math="3.5" /> days. The rental price for tractor 1 is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}54,000.00" /> per day, tractor 2 is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}27,000.00" /> per day, and the rental price for tractor 3 is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}45,000.00" /> per day. Tractor rental does not have to be for a full day with proportional costs.

If on the first day the farmer uses only tractors 1 and 3, the portion of the field that can be plowed by both tractors is ... part.
