We will calculate the monthly interest Juju has to pay based on the laptop price, down payment, and applicable interest rate. Note that the <InlineMath math="20\%" /> discount only applies to series <InlineMath math="A" /> laptops, while Juju buys a series <InlineMath math="B" /> laptop, so the normal price applies.

#### Calculating Down Payment

Juju buys a laptop for <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}20,000,000.00" /> and pays a down payment of <InlineMath math="10\%" />.

<BlockMath math="\text{Down Payment} = 10\% \times 20,000,000 = 2,000,000" />

So, the down payment paid is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}2,000,000.00" />.

#### Calculating Remaining Loan Amount

The remaining loan amount (principal) is the initial price minus the down payment.

<BlockMath math="\text{Remaining Loan} = 20,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 18,000,000" />

The remaining amount to be paid in installments is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}18,000,000.00" />.

#### Determining Interest Rate

The normal simple interest is known to be <InlineMath math="6\%" /> per year. There is a provision for interest reduction if the down payment is greater than <InlineMath math="10\%" /> (subsequent multiples). Since Juju only pays the minimum down payment of <InlineMath math="10\%" />, she does not get an interest reduction.

The applicable interest rate remains <InlineMath math="6\%" /> per year.

#### Calculating Monthly Interest

Annual interest is calculated from the remaining loan:

<BlockMath math="\text{Annual Interest} = 6\% \times 18,000,000" />

Since the question asks for monthly interest, we divide the annual interest by 12:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Monthly Interest} = \frac{6\%}{12} \times 18,000,000" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Monthly Interest} = 0.5\% \times 18,000,000" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Monthly Interest} = 90,000" />
</MathContainer>

So, the interest Juju has to pay per month is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}90,000.00" />.
