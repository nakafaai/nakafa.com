#### Arithmetic Sequence Analysis

The pattern of temperature decrease in the table forms an arithmetic sequence. For every <InlineMath math="100 \text{ m}" /> increase in altitude, the temperature drops by <InlineMath math="2^\circ\text{C}" />.

Given:
- The first term (<InlineMath math="U_1" />) at an altitude of <InlineMath math="100 \text{ m}" /> is <InlineMath math="32" />.
- The common difference (<InlineMath math="b" />) is <InlineMath math="-2" />.

An altitude of <InlineMath math="800 \text{ m}" /> corresponds to the 8th term (<InlineMath math="U_8" />), and an altitude of <InlineMath math="1200 \text{ m}" /> corresponds to the 12th term (<InlineMath math="U_{12}" />).

The formula for the <InlineMath math="n" />-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:

<BlockMath math="U_n = a + (n-1)b" />

So, the ratio of the air temperature at the two altitudes is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\frac{U_8}{U_{12}} = \frac{32 + (8-1)(-2)}{32 + (12-1)(-2)}" />
  <BlockMath math="\frac{U_8}{U_{12}} = \frac{32 + (7)(-2)}{32 + (11)(-2)}" />
  <BlockMath math="\frac{U_8}{U_{12}} = \frac{32 - 14}{32 - 22}" />
  <BlockMath math="\frac{U_8}{U_{12}} = \frac{18}{10}" />
  <BlockMath math="\frac{U_8}{U_{12}} = \frac{9}{5}" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the temperature ratio is <InlineMath math="9:5" />.
