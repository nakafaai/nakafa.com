#### Track Analysis

The track is circular with <InlineMath math="4" /> checkpoints: <InlineMath math="A, B, C, D" />. A full lap consists of <InlineMath math="4" /> segments: <InlineMath math="A \to B" />, <InlineMath math="B \to C" />, <InlineMath math="C \to D" />, and <InlineMath math="D \to A" />. The journey starts from <InlineMath math="A" />.

#### Calculating Initial Distance

The runner passes checkpoint <InlineMath math="C" /> <InlineMath math="3" /> times.

- **1st time:** <InlineMath math="A \to B \to C" /> (<InlineMath math="2" /> segments).
- **2nd time:** Add 1 full lap (<InlineMath math="4" /> segments). Total: <InlineMath math="2 + 4 = 6" /> segments.
- **3rd time:** Add 1 full lap (<InlineMath math="4" /> segments). Total: <InlineMath math="6 + 4 = 10" /> segments.

It is known that the travel time for <InlineMath math="10" /> segments is <InlineMath math="12" /> minutes. The time per segment (<InlineMath math="t_s" />) is:

<BlockMath math="t_s = \frac{12}{10} = 1.2 \text{ minutes}" />

#### Calculating Total Time

To reach checkpoint <InlineMath math="C" /> for the 4th time, the runner must cover 1 more lap (<InlineMath math="4" /> segments). The total segments covered are:

<BlockMath math="10 + 4 = 14 \text{ segments}" />

Thus, the total time required is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="T = 14 \times 1.2 \text{ minutes}" />
  <BlockMath math="= 16.8 \text{ minutes}" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the time required by the runner is <InlineMath math="16.8 \text{ minutes}" />.
