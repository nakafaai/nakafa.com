In a coastal area, the highest wave reaches <InlineMath math="16 \text{ meters}" /> from crest to trough. The wave takes <InlineMath math="6 \text{ hours } 12 \text{ minutes}" /> to move from the highest crest to the trough, so the time required from crest to crest is <InlineMath math="12 \text{ hours } 24 \text{ minutes}" />.

The following is a possible **wave height function <InlineMath math="h(t)" /> in meters** with respect to time <InlineMath math="t" /> in hours...
