City A is a city located on the coast but surrounded by high hills. The following is a table of air temperature in City A at each altitude of its region.

| Altitude (m) | <InlineMath math="100" /> | <InlineMath math="200" /> | <InlineMath math="300" /> | <InlineMath math="400" /> | <InlineMath math="500" /> | <InlineMath math="600" /> |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Temperature (<InlineMath math="^\circ\text{C}" />) | <InlineMath math="32" /> | <InlineMath math="30" /> | <InlineMath math="28" /> | <InlineMath math="26" /> | <InlineMath math="24" /> | <InlineMath math="22" /> |

The temperature in City A decreases by a constant value as the altitude measured from sea level increases.

What is the ratio of the air temperature at an altitude of <InlineMath math="800 \text{ m}" /> to <InlineMath math="1200 \text{ m}" />?
