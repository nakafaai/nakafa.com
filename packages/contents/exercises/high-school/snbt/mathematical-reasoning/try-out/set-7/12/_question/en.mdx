A map has a scale of <InlineMath math="1:2,000,000" /> and on the map, there are several cities with distances as follows:

- City <InlineMath math="A" /> to city <InlineMath math="x" /> = <InlineMath math="2.5 \text{ cm}" />
- City <InlineMath math="x" /> to city <InlineMath math="B" /> = <InlineMath math="3 \text{ cm}" />
- City <InlineMath math="A" /> to city <InlineMath math="y" /> = <InlineMath math="4 \text{ cm}" />
- City <InlineMath math="y" /> to city <InlineMath math="B" /> = <InlineMath math="4.5 \text{ cm}" />

Benu and Mamang will travel from city <InlineMath math="A" /> to city <InlineMath math="B" /> via different routes. Benu takes the route passing through city <InlineMath math="x" />, while Mamang passes through city <InlineMath math="y" />.

The difference in travel distance between Benu and Mamang is....
