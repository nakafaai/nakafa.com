#### Identify Information

Given:
- Two study groups, let's call them <InlineMath math="A" /> and <InlineMath math="B" />.
- Number of members is the same: <InlineMath math="n_A = n_B = 4" />.
- Initial average weights: <InlineMath math="\bar{x}_A = 30" /> and <InlineMath math="\bar{x}_B = 33" />.
- Initial total weights:

  <MathContainer>
    <BlockMath math="\sum x_A = n_A \cdot \bar{x}_A = 4 \cdot 30 = 120" />
    <BlockMath math="\sum x_B = n_B \cdot \bar{x}_B = 4 \cdot 33 = 132" />
  </MathContainer>

#### Analyze the Exchange

Let the exchanged children be <InlineMath math="x_A" /> from group <InlineMath math="A" /> and <InlineMath math="x_B" /> from group <InlineMath math="B" />. After the exchange, the number of members remains the same (<InlineMath math="n = 4" />) and the averages become equal, which means the new total weights are also equal.

New total weight of group <InlineMath math="A" /> (<InlineMath math="\sum x_A'" />):

<BlockMath math="\sum x_A' = \sum x_A - x_A + x_B = 120 - x_A + x_B" />

New total weight of group <InlineMath math="B" /> (<InlineMath math="\sum x_B'" />):

<BlockMath math="\sum x_B' = \sum x_B - x_B + x_A = 132 - x_B + x_A" />

#### Calculate Weight Difference

Since the new averages are equal, the new total sums are also equal:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\sum x_A' = \sum x_B'" />
  <BlockMath math="120 - x_A + x_B = 132 - x_B + x_A" />
</MathContainer>

Group similar variables:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="x_B + x_B - x_A - x_A = 132 - 120" />
  <BlockMath math="2x_B - 2x_A = 12" />
  <BlockMath math="2(x_B - x_A) = 12" />
  <BlockMath math="x_B - x_A = 6" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the difference in weight between the two exchanged children is <InlineMath math="6 \text{ kg}" />.
