Suppose for a simple case, an eagle flies above the surface of a river and sees a fish at a depth of <InlineMath math="3" /> meters from the river surface. An angle of <InlineMath math="30^\circ" /> is formed between the fish and the Eagle's line of sight. If the line of sight distance between the Eagle and the Fish is <InlineMath math="18" /> meters, then the height of the Eagle above the river surface is .... (ignore the refractive index of water)
