#### Arithmetic Sequence Identification

Based on the information, Mr. Brikson's salary forms an arithmetic sequence with:

- Salary this year (age <InlineMath math="40" />) as the first term (<InlineMath math="a" />): <InlineMath math="a = 15.750.000" />
- Annual salary increase as the common difference (<InlineMath math="b" />): <InlineMath math="b = 750.000" />

We need to find the salary at age <InlineMath math="54" />. The difference in years from age <InlineMath math="40" /> to <InlineMath math="54" /> is:

<BlockMath math="n_{years} = 54 - 40 = 14 \text{ years}" />

Since the salary increases every year, the salary at age <InlineMath math="54" /> is the initial salary plus <InlineMath math="14" /> increases.

#### Salary Calculation

Using the formula for the <InlineMath math="n" />-th term (where <InlineMath math="n" /> here represents the 15th year of the sequence, i.e., after 14 increases):

<BlockMath math="U_{15} = a + (15-1)b = a + 14b" />

Substituting the values:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Salary} = 15.750.000 + 14(750.000)" />
  <BlockMath math="= 15.750.000 + 10.500.000" />
  <BlockMath math="= 26.250.000" />
</MathContainer>

So, Mr. Brikson's salary when he is <InlineMath math="54" /> years old is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}26.250.000,00" />.
