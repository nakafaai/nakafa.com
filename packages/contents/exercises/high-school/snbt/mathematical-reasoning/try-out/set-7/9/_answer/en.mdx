#### Position Equation

The collision event occurs when the position function with respect to time, for both the rocket and the ship, has the same value.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="s(t) = s(t)" />
  <BlockMath math="60t = 4000 - t^2" />
  <BlockMath math="t^2 + 60t - 4000 = 0" />
</MathContainer>

Factor the quadratic equation:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="(t - 40)(t + 100) = 0" />
  <BlockMath math="t - 40 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad t + 100 = 0" />
  <BlockMath math="t = 40 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -100" />
</MathContainer>

Since time cannot be negative, the positive value is used. This means they collide when <InlineMath math="t = 40" /> seconds.
