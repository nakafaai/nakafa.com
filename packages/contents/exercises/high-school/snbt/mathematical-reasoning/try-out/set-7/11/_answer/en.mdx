#### First Box Probability

The first box contains <InlineMath math="4" /> red balls and <InlineMath math="3" /> blue balls.
The total number of balls in the first box is:

<BlockMath math="n(S_1) = 4 + 3 = 7" />

The probability of drawing a red ball from the first box (<InlineMath math="M" />) is:

<BlockMath math="P(M) = \frac{n(M)}{n(S_1)} = \frac{4}{7}" />

#### Second Box Probability

The second box contains <InlineMath math="7" /> red balls and <InlineMath math="3" /> white balls.
The total number of balls in the second box is:

<BlockMath math="n(S_2) = 7 + 3 = 10" />

The probability of drawing a white ball from the second box (<InlineMath math="P" />) is:

<BlockMath math="P(P) = \frac{n(P)}{n(S_2)} = \frac{3}{10}" />

#### Combined Probability

Since drawing balls from the two boxes are independent events, the probability of drawing a red ball from the first box **and** a white ball from the second box is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P(M \cap P) = P(M) \times P(P)" />
  <BlockMath math="= \frac{4}{7} \times \frac{3}{10}" />
  <BlockMath math="= \frac{12}{70}" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the probability is <InlineMath math="\frac{12}{70}" />.
