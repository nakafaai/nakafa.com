A running athlete is training. The training is done in an arena with a circular track. There are <InlineMath math="4" /> checkpoints on the track, namely <InlineMath math="A - B - C - D" />, with equal distances between checkpoints. Suppose the runner has passed checkpoint <InlineMath math="C" /> (from <InlineMath math="A" />) <InlineMath math="3" /> times in <InlineMath math="12" /> minutes.

Then the time required for the runner to reach exactly at checkpoint <InlineMath math="C" /> for the fourth time is....
