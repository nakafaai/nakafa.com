#### Problem Visualization

Here is an illustration of the eagle and fish positions based on the problem information:

<Graph 
  title="Eagle and Fish Positions"
  description={<>Visualization of the eagle's line of sight to the fish with a <InlineMath math="30^\circ" /> angle of depression.</>}
  labels={{
    eagle: "Eagle",
    fish: "Fish",
    surface: "Water Surface",
    sightDistance: "18 m"
  }}
/>

#### Identify Variables

Given:
- Depth of fish from water surface (<InlineMath math="y_1" />) = <InlineMath math="3 \text{ m}" />.
- Total line of sight distance (Eagle to Fish) = <InlineMath math="18 \text{ m}" />.
- Angle between line of sight and water surface = <InlineMath math="30^\circ" />.

Let:
- <InlineMath math="r_1" /> = line of sight distance from fish to the water surface point.
- <InlineMath math="r_2" /> = line of sight distance from eagle to the water surface point.
- <InlineMath math="y_2" /> = height of eagle from water surface.

#### Calculate Fish to Surface Distance

Consider the right triangle formed by the fish's position and the water surface. Using the sine concept:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\sin 30^\circ = \frac{y_1}{r_1}" />
  <BlockMath math="\frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{r_1}" />
  <BlockMath math="r_1 = 3 \cdot 2 = 6 \text{ m}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculate Eagle to Surface Distance

The total line of sight distance is the sum of the distance from the fish to the surface and the distance from the eagle to the surface:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="R_{\text{total}} = r_1 + r_2" />
  <BlockMath math="18 = 6 + r_2" />
  <BlockMath math="r_2 = 18 - 6 = 12 \text{ m}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculate Eagle Height

Now consider the right triangle formed by the eagle's position and the water surface. Again, use the sine concept:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\sin 30^\circ = \frac{y_2}{r_2}" />
  <BlockMath math="\frac{1}{2} = \frac{y_2}{12}" />
  <BlockMath math="y_2 = 12 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ m}" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the height of the eagle above the river surface is <InlineMath math="6 \text{ m}" />.
