**Proportion Analysis**

We have the visitor ratio for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday as follows:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Ratio} = 3 + x + 5 = 8 + x" />
</MathContainer>

It is known that Friday accounts for <InlineMath math="x" /> parts of this total ratio. The number of Friday visitors is <InlineMath math="24" /> out of a total of <InlineMath math="120" /> people.

**Calculating the Value of x**

We can set up an equation using the fractional part concept:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\frac{\text{Friday's Part}}{\text{Total Parts}} \times \text{Total Visitors} = \text{Friday's Visitors}" />
  <BlockMath math="\frac{x}{8 + x} \times 120 = 24" />
</MathContainer>

Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by <InlineMath math="24" /> (since <InlineMath math="120 \div 24 = 5" />):

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="5x = 8 + x" />
  <BlockMath math="4x = 8" />
  <BlockMath math="x = 2" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the value of <InlineMath math="x" /> is <InlineMath math="2" />.
