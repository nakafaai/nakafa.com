A tank is filled with water through a tap. At the bottom of the tank, there is a small hole through which water flows out. Suppose the volume of water filling the tank from the tap is expressed by the function:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="V_1(t) = 2t^2 - 198t + 4700" />
</MathContainer>

While the volume of water flowing out is expressed by the function:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="V_2(t) = 500 + 2t" />
</MathContainer>

Where <InlineMath math="t" /> is time in minutes.

Determine the time when the volume of water entering equals the water flowing out!
