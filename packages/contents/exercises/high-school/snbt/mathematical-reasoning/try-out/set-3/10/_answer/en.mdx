**Calculating Total Balls**

The bag contains <InlineMath math="4" /> green balls and <InlineMath math="5" /> black balls.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Balls} = 4 + 5 = 9" />
</MathContainer>

**Probability of First Green Ball**

The probability of drawing a green ball on the first draw is the number of green balls divided by the total number of balls.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P(G_1) = \frac{4}{9}" />
</MathContainer>

**Probability of Second Green Ball**

Since the draw is **without replacement**, the number of green balls decreases to <InlineMath math="3" /> and the total number of balls decreases to <InlineMath math="8" />.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P(G_2|G_1) = \frac{3}{8}" />
</MathContainer>

**Calculating Total Probability**

The probability that both balls are green is the product of these two probabilities:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P(Total) = P(G_1) \times P(G_2|G_1)" />
  <BlockMath math="P(Total) = \frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{8}" />
  <BlockMath math="P(Total) = \frac{12}{72}" />
  <BlockMath math="P(Total) = \frac{1}{6}" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the probability that both balls are green is <InlineMath math="\frac{1}{6}" />.
