A fishing boat moves from an initial position towards a pier for a distance of <InlineMath math="2\text{ km}" />. An observer on the boat observes the top of a hill with an elevation angle of <InlineMath math="37^\circ" />. The distance from the observer to the top of the hill at that time is <InlineMath math="12\text{ km}" />. When arriving at the pier, the observation elevation angle changes to <InlineMath math="53^\circ" />.

What is the distance from the base of the hill to the end of the pier?

Given:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\sin 53^\circ = 0.8 \rightarrow \cos 53^\circ = 0.6" />
  <BlockMath math="\sin 37^\circ = 0.6 \rightarrow \cos 37^\circ = 0.8" />
</MathContainer>
