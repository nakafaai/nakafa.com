**Filling Slots Method**

We have <InlineMath math="7" /> flags with a specific condition: **Armenia** and **Belgium** must be at the ends of the row. We can visualize the arrangement using slots (boxes).

**Step 1: Determine End Positions**

There are only <InlineMath math="2" /> possibilities for the ends: Armenia on the left and Belgium on the right, or vice versa. Thus, we write the number <InlineMath math="2" /> in the first box as the multiplier for the end variations.

**Step 2: Fill Middle Positions**

There are <InlineMath math="5" /> remaining flags (China, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, Ghana) to fill the <InlineMath math="5" /> middle positions. We fill the remaining slots in descending order (<InlineMath math="5, 4, 3, 2, 1" />) following the permutation principle.

Here is the visualization of the filled slots:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline 2 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}" />
</MathContainer>

The number <InlineMath math="2" /> represents the ways to arrange the ends.

The numbers <InlineMath math="5, 4, 3, 2, 1" /> represent the ways to arrange the <InlineMath math="5" /> middle flags (<InlineMath math="5!" />).

**Final Calculation**

The total number of ways is the product of all numbers in the boxes.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = 2 \times (5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1)" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = 2 \times 5!" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = 2(5!)" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, there are <InlineMath math="2(5!)" /> ways to arrange the flags.
