We need to find the number of days **without** shipments of oil <InlineMath math="A" /> or <InlineMath math="B" />. The most efficient way is to count the days **with** shipments, then subtract that from the total days in April (<InlineMath math="30" /> days).

Here is the breakdown of the delivery schedule:

| Oil Type | Delivery Dates (Arithmetic Sequence) | Total Days |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **Oil A** (Every <InlineMath math="3" /> days) | <InlineMath math="1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28" /> | <InlineMath math="10" /> |
| **Oil B** (Every <InlineMath math="4" /> days) | <InlineMath math="1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29" /> | <InlineMath math="8" /> |
| **Union** (A <InlineMath math="\cup" /> B) | <InlineMath math="1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 25, 28, 29" /> | **<InlineMath math="15" />** |

From the table above, there are **<InlineMath math="15" /> days** where the shop receives a shipment (either A, B, or both).

Thus, the number of days **without** shipments is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Empty Days} = \text{Total April} - \text{Delivery Days}" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Empty Days} = 30 - 15 = 15" />
</MathContainer>

So, there are **<InlineMath math="15" /> days** where the shop did not receive any shipment of oil <InlineMath math="A" /> or <InlineMath math="B" />.
