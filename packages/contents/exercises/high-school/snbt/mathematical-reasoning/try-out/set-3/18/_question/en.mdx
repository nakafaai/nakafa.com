A helicopter is about to park on a helipad on top of a building. The building has a height of <InlineMath math="16" /> meters. In front of the base of the building, a man stands with a shadow length of <InlineMath math="x" />. The distance from the building to the man is <InlineMath math="32" /> meters.

  labels={{

  }}
/>

From the tip of the shadow, an angle of elevation of <InlineMath math="30^\circ" /> is formed to the top of the building and <InlineMath math="45^\circ" /> to the helicopter's position. If the inclined lines represent the line of sight to the top of the building and the helicopter, then the height of the helicopter from the helipad is... meters.
