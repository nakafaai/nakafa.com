**First Offer Analysis**

Supri receives a fixed salary of <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}75,000.00" /> per day for <InlineMath math="7" /> days.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total}_1 = 7 \times 75,000 = \text{Rp}525,000.00" />
</MathContainer>

**Second Offer Analysis**

Supri receives <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}10,000.00" /> on the first day, doubling each subsequent day. This is a geometric series with <InlineMath math="a = 10,000" />, <InlineMath math="r = 2" />, and <InlineMath math="n = 7" />.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="S_n = \frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1}" />
  <BlockMath math="S_7 = \frac{10,000(2^7 - 1)}{2 - 1}" />
  <BlockMath math="S_7 = 10,000(128 - 1)" />
  <BlockMath math="S_7 = 10,000(127) = \text{Rp}1,270,000.00" />
</MathContainer>

Comparing the total income from both offers:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Rp}1,270,000.00 > \text{Rp}525,000.00" />
