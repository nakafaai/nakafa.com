Bima works as a private employee. Every year, he receives a Religious Holiday Allowance (THR) from his company. In the first year, he is given a THR of <InlineMath math="10\%" /> of his monthly salary. In the second year, the THR given is twice the amount of the first year's THR. In the third year, the THR is twice the amount of the second year's THR, and so on following this pattern.

If in <InlineMath math="2023" /> Bima receives a salary of <InlineMath math="Rp3.000.000,00" /> per month, what is the total amount of THR Bima receives after working for <InlineMath math="5" /> years?
