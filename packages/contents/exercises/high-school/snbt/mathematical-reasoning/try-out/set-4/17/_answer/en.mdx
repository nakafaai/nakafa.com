To solve this problem, we need to understand the statistical properties regarding data transformation. Remember the key principles:
1. **Mean** changes according to all arithmetic operations (multiplication, division, addition, subtraction).
2. **Range** changes only with multiplication or division, but **remains unchanged** with addition or subtraction.

First, let's find the value of <InlineMath math="p" /> using the range information. Since the initial range of <InlineMath math="6" /> becomes <InlineMath math="9" /> after being multiplied by <InlineMath math="p" />, we have:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{New Range} = |p| \times \text{Old Range}" />
  <BlockMath math="9 = p \times 6" />
  <BlockMath math="p = \frac{9}{6} = \frac{3}{2}" />
</MathContainer>

Next, we find the value of <InlineMath math="q" /> using the mean information. The mean is affected by both the multiplication by <InlineMath math="p" /> and the subtraction by <InlineMath math="q" />.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{New Mean} = (p \times \text{Old Mean}) - q" />
  <BlockMath math="20 = \left(\frac{3}{2} \times 16\right) - q" />
  <BlockMath math="20 = 24 - q" />
  <BlockMath math="q = 4" />
</MathContainer>

Finally, calculate the requested value using <InlineMath math="p" /> and <InlineMath math="q" />.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="2p + q = 2\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) + 4" />
  <BlockMath math="2p + q = 3 + 4 = 7" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the value of <InlineMath math="2p + q" /> is <InlineMath math="7" />.
