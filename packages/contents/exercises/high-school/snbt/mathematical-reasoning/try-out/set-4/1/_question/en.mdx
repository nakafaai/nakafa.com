Toko Maju receives shipments of cooking oil from three suppliers for resale with the following schedule:

| Oil | Delivery Schedule | Volume per shipment (liters) |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| <InlineMath math="A" /> | Every <InlineMath math="3" /> days | <InlineMath math="10" /> |
| <InlineMath math="B" /> | Every <InlineMath math="4" /> days | <InlineMath math="15" /> |
| <InlineMath math="C" /> | Every <InlineMath math="x" /> days | <InlineMath math="20" /> |

On April <InlineMath math="1" />, <InlineMath math="2023" />, the shop received shipments of oil brands <InlineMath math="A" />, <InlineMath math="B" />, and <InlineMath math="C" /> simultaneously for the first time.

Starting from May <InlineMath math="1" />, <InlineMath math="2023" />, the volume of oil brand <InlineMath math="A" /> is increased to <InlineMath math="15" /> liters per shipment.

What is the difference in the volume of oil brand <InlineMath math="A" /> received by Toko Maju in May compared to April?
