We will compare the total volume of oil <InlineMath math="A" /> received in April (30 days) and May (31 days). Note that the delivery schedule for oil <InlineMath math="A" /> is every <InlineMath math="3" /> days.

Here is the detailed comparison:

| Month | Total Days | Volume per Shipment | Delivery Dates | Total Shipments | Total Volume |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **April** | <InlineMath math="30" /> | <InlineMath math="10" /> liters | <InlineMath math="1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28" /> | <InlineMath math="10" /> times | <InlineMath math="10 \times 10 = 100" /> liters |
| **May** | <InlineMath math="31" /> | <InlineMath math="15" /> liters | <InlineMath math="1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31" /> | <InlineMath math="11" /> times | <InlineMath math="11 \times 15 = 165" /> liters |

Notice that in May, there are <InlineMath math="11" /> shipments because May <InlineMath math="31" /> is also a scheduled delivery date (3 days after the 28th).

Thus, the difference in volume for oil <InlineMath math="A" /> is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\Delta V = V_{\text{May}} - V_{\text{April}}" />
  <BlockMath math="\Delta V = 165 - 100 = 65 \text{ liters}" />
</MathContainer>

So, the difference in the volume of oil brand <InlineMath math="A" /> received is <InlineMath math="65" /> liters.
