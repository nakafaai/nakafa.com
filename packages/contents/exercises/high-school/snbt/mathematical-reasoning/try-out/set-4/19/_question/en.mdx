Ship <InlineMath math="A" /> stops in the middle of the sea. The captain sees two other ships that also stop. Ship <InlineMath math="C" /> is aligned with ship <InlineMath math="A" />, while ship <InlineMath math="B" /> is perpendicular to <InlineMath math="AC" />. If the distance from ship <InlineMath math="B" /> to ship <InlineMath math="C" /> is <InlineMath math="500\text{ meter}" /> and the included angle between <InlineMath math="AC" /> and <InlineMath math="BC" /> is <InlineMath math="60^\circ" />, then the distance from ship <InlineMath math="A" /> to ship <InlineMath math="B" /> is ....
