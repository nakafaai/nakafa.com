The concept used is Uniform Linear Motion. Since both cars are moving towards each other to meet, the total distance covered by both cars is equal to their initial separation distance.

The relationship between the distances covered can be written as:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="S_{total} = S_A + S_B" />
  <BlockMath math="85 = v_A \cdot t + v_B \cdot t" />
</MathContainer>

We substitute the speed values of each car to find the time <InlineMath math="t" />:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="85 = 10t + 7t" />
  <BlockMath math="85 = 17t" />
  <BlockMath math="t = \frac{85}{17}" />
  <BlockMath math="t = 5" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, they will pass each other after <InlineMath math="5" /> seconds.
