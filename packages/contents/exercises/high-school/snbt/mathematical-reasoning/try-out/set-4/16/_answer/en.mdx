To solve this problem easily, we use the principle of **Sum of Values Balance**. The combined total score must equal the sum of the total scores of each group.

Let <InlineMath math="n" /> be the initial number of students. We can set up an equation based on the total values as follows:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Initial Total} + \text{New Total} = \text{Combined Total}" />
  <BlockMath math="59n + (70 \times 4) = 60(n + 4)" />
</MathContainer>

Next, we solve this simple linear equation. Notice how we group the terms containing <InlineMath math="n" />.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="59n + 280 = 60n + 240" />
  <BlockMath math="280 - 240 = 60n - 59n" />
  <BlockMath math="40 = n" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the number of students before being combined is <InlineMath math="40" />.
