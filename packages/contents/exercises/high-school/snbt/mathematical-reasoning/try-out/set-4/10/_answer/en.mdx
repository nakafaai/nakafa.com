Since each married couple must ride in the same car, we can treat each couple as a single unit. There are a total of <InlineMath math="5" /> couple units to be distributed into <InlineMath math="2" /> cars.

The capacity of each car is <InlineMath math="6" /> passengers, which is equivalent to <InlineMath math="3" /> married couples. Therefore, the number of couples in a single car cannot exceed <InlineMath math="3" />. The possible distributions of couples for Car A and Car B that satisfy the capacity constraint are:
1. Car A carries <InlineMath math="3" /> couples, Car B carries <InlineMath math="2" /> couples.
2. Car A carries <InlineMath math="2" /> couples, Car B carries <InlineMath math="3" /> couples.

For the first case, we choose <InlineMath math="3" /> couples out of the <InlineMath math="5" /> available to go into Car A. The remaining couples automatically go to Car B.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="C(5, 3) = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3!}{3! \times 2 \times 1} = 10 \text{ ways}" />
</MathContainer>

For the second case, we choose <InlineMath math="2" /> couples out of the <InlineMath math="5" /> available to go into Car A.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="C(5, 2) = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3!}{2 \times 1 \times 3!} = 10 \text{ ways}" />
</MathContainer>

The total number of ways to arrange the passengers is the sum of both possibilities.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="10 + 10 = 20 \text{ ways}" />
</MathContainer>
