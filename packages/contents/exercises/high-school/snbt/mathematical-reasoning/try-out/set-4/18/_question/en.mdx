A fishing boat moves from an initial position towards a pier for a distance of <InlineMath math="2\text{ km}" />. An observer on the boat sees the top of a hill with an elevation angle of <InlineMath math="37^\circ" />. The line-of-sight distance from the observer to the hilltop at the initial position is <InlineMath math="12\text{ km}" />. After the boat arrives at the pier, the elevation angle becomes <InlineMath math="53^\circ" />. What is the height of the hill?

Given:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\sin 53^\circ = 0.8 \rightarrow \cos 53^\circ = 0.6" />
  <BlockMath math="\sin 37^\circ = 0.6 \rightarrow \cos 37^\circ = 0.8" />
</MathContainer>
