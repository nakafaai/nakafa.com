This problem can be solved using the concept of a **Linear Function** or an **Arithmetic Sequence**, because the land price increase is constant (fixed) every year.

The initial land price (<InlineMath math="a" />) is given as <InlineMath math="10,000,000" /> and the annual price increase (<InlineMath math="b" />) is <InlineMath math="1,200,000" />. We want to find the land price after <InlineMath math="5" /> years.

If we model this as a linear function where <InlineMath math="y" /> is the land price and <InlineMath math="x" /> is the number of years, the equation is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="y = \text{Initial Price} + (\text{Increase} \times \text{Years})" />
  <BlockMath math="y = 10,000,000 + (1,200,000 \times x)" />
</MathContainer>

Substitute <InlineMath math="x = 5" /> to calculate the land price after <InlineMath math="5" /> years:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="y = 10,000,000 + (1,200,000 \times 5)" />
  <BlockMath math="y = 10,000,000 + 6,000,000" />
  <BlockMath math="y = 16,000,000" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the land price in <InlineMath math="5" /> years will be **<InlineMath math="Rp16.000.000,00" />** per square meter.
