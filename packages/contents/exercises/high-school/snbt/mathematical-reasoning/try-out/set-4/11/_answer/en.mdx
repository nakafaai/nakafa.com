The probability of selecting a student who wears a watch is determined by the ratio of students wearing watches to the total number of students. Let's calculate these components first.

**Male students wearing watches:**

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5" />
</MathContainer>

**Female students wearing watches:**

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the total number of students wearing watches (<InlineMath math="n(A)" />) and the total number of students (<InlineMath math="n(S)" />) are:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="n(A) = 5 + 10 = 15" />
  <BlockMath math="n(S) = 10 + 20 = 30" />
</MathContainer>

The probability of selecting a student who wears a watch is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)} = \frac{15}{30} = \frac{1}{2}" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the probability is <InlineMath math="\frac{1}{2}" />.
