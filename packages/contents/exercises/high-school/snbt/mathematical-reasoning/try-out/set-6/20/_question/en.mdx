A coach is training <InlineMath math="3" /> students. The exercise performed is jogging on a circular track. Jogging starts at <InlineMath math="07.00" /> from the start line. Below is the record of how long it takes for each runner to return to the start line.

| Runner | Returns to start line |
| :--- | :--- |
| A | Every <InlineMath math="12" /> minutes |
| B | Every <InlineMath math="x" /> minutes |
| C | Every <InlineMath math="9" /> minutes |

According to the coach's notes, until exactly <InlineMath math="09.24" />, the three runners have passed the start line together <InlineMath math="4" /> times.

Given that runner A's speed is <InlineMath math="2" /> m/s.

<InlineMath math="72" /> minutes after they started running, the difference in the length of the track covered by runner A and C is ....
