A train consists of <InlineMath math="8" /> train carriages. One carriage has a seating capacity for <InlineMath math="25" /> passengers. The train passes through <InlineMath math="8" /> stations.

The transportation management sets a base fare of <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}2,500.00" /> for the first kilometer. And it increases by <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}1,000.00" /> for each subsequent <InlineMath math="1" /> kilometer.

Suppose Bedu wants to travel from the first station to the <InlineMath math="5" />th station, which is a distance of <InlineMath math="18" /> km. What is the total fare he has to pay?
