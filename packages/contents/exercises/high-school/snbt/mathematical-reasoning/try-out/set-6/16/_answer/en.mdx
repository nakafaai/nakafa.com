#### Calculating Initial Total Weight

The initial average weight <InlineMath math="(\bar{x}_1)" /> of ten players <InlineMath math="(n_1 = 10)" /> is <InlineMath math="60" /> kg. The initial total weight can be calculated as follows:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\sum x_1 = \bar{x}_1 \cdot n_1" />
  <BlockMath math="\sum x_1 = 60 \times 10 = 600 \text{ kg}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating the Weight of the Replaced Player

Let the weight of the replaced player be <InlineMath math="n" /> and Iksan's weight be <InlineMath math="x_i = 62" /> kg.

After the replacement, the number of players remains <InlineMath math="10" />, but the average weight becomes <InlineMath math="\bar{x}_2 = 60.5" /> kg. The equation is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\bar{x}_2 = \frac{\sum x_1 - n + x_i}{n_1}" />
</MathContainer>

Substitute the known values:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="60.5 = \frac{600 - n + 62}{10}" />
</MathContainer>

Multiply both sides by <InlineMath math="10" />:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="605 = 600 - n + 62" />
  <BlockMath math="605 = 662 - n" />
</MathContainer>

Move <InlineMath math="n" /> to the left side and <InlineMath math="605" /> to the right side:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="n = 662 - 605" />
  <BlockMath math="n = 57" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the weight of the futsal player replaced by Iksan is <InlineMath math="57" /> kg.
