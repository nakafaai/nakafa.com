#### Calculating Cost Components

The total cost Bedu has to pay is the sum of the base fare (for the first kilometer) and the total fare for the subsequent kilometers.

Given:
- Total distance = <InlineMath math="18" /> km.
- Base fare (first 1 km) = <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}2,500" />.
- Additional fare per km = <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}1,000" />.

Remaining distance subject to additional fare:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Remaining Distance} = 18 \text{ km} - 1 \text{ km} = 17 \text{ km}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating Total Fare

We calculate the total cost:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = \text{Base Fare} + (\text{Remaining Distance} \times \text{Additional Fare})" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = \text{Rp}2,500 + (17 \times \text{Rp}1,000)" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = \text{Rp}2,500 + \text{Rp}17,000" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = \text{Rp}19,500" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the total fare Bedu has to pay is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}19,500.00" />.
