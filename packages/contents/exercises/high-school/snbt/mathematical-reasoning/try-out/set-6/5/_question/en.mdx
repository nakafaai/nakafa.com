Two types of sand, sand A and sand B, are poured separately to form cones. The base radius of sand cone A is always equal to its height, while the base radius of sand cone B is twice its height. <InlineMath math="P_1" /> is the center of the base of sand pile A and <InlineMath math="P_2" /> is the center of the base of sand pile B. The distance between <InlineMath math="P_1" /> and <InlineMath math="P_2" /> is <InlineMath math="10" /> m.

If both types of sand are poured at the same volumetric rate, then <InlineMath math="R_1 : R_2 = ...." />
