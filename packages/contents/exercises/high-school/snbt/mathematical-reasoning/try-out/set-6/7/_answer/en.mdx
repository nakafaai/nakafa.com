#### Determining the Common Difference

January is the first month (<InlineMath math="U_1" />), so the number of cars produced is <InlineMath math="a = 100" /> units. April is the 4th month (<InlineMath math="U_4" />), with a production of <InlineMath math="160" /> units.

We can find the common difference (<InlineMath math="b" />) of this arithmetic sequence using the <InlineMath math="n" />-th term formula:

<BlockMath math="U_n = a + (n - 1)b" />

Substitute the known values for April (<InlineMath math="n=4" />):

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="160 = 100 + (4 - 1)b" />
  <BlockMath math="160 = 100 + 3b" />
  <BlockMath math="60 = 3b" />
  <BlockMath math="b = 20" />
</MathContainer>

So, production increases by <InlineMath math="20" /> units each month.

#### Calculating Total Annual Production

Total production until the end of the year means the sum of production for <InlineMath math="12" /> months (<InlineMath math="S_{12}" />). We use the arithmetic series sum formula:

<BlockMath math="S_n = \frac{n}{2} \{2a + (n - 1)b\}" />

Substitute <InlineMath math="n = 12" />, <InlineMath math="a = 100" />, and <InlineMath math="b = 20" />:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="S_{12} = \frac{12}{2} \{2(100) + (12 - 1)(20)\}" />
  <BlockMath math="S_{12} = 6 \{200 + (11)(20)\}" />
  <BlockMath math="S_{12} = 6 (200 + 220)" />
  <BlockMath math="S_{12} = 6 (420)" />
  <BlockMath math="S_{12} = 2520" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the total number of cars that can be produced by the end of the year is <InlineMath math="2,520" /> units.
