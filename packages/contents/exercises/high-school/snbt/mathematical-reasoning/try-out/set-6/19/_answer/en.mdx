#### Problem Identification

We have a situation where a sniper is at a certain height shooting at a target below. We need to find the tangent of the angle of depression (<InlineMath math="\tan \alpha" />).

<Graph 
  title={<>Illustration of Sniper and Target Position</>}
  description={<>Right-angled triangle formed by the sniper, target, and building base.</>}
  label={{ horizontal: "Horizontal" }}
/>

#### Determining Effective Height (Opposite Side)

The building height is <InlineMath math="61.73" /> meters. The target height is <InlineMath math="173" /> cm. We need to convert units first.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="173 \text{ cm} = 1.73 \text{ meters}" />
</MathContainer>

The height difference between the sniper (assumed at the top of the building) and the target's head is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Effective Height} = \text{Building Height} - \text{Target Height}" />
  <BlockMath math="opposite = 61.73 - 1.73 = 60 \text{ meters}" />
</MathContainer>

This is the opposite side (<InlineMath math="opposite" />) for the angle of elevation (which is equal to the angle of depression).

#### Determining Horizontal Distance (Adjacent Side)

The horizontal distance from the base of the building to the target is known to be <InlineMath math="180" /> meters. This is the adjacent side (<InlineMath math="adjacent" />).

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="adjacent = 180 \text{ meters}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating Tangent of Angle of Depression

The angle of depression (<InlineMath math="\alpha" />) has a tangent value equal to the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in the formed right-angled triangle.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\tan \alpha = \frac{opposite}{adjacent}" />
  <BlockMath math="\tan \alpha = \frac{60}{180}" />
</MathContainer>

Simplify the fraction:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\tan \alpha = \frac{1}{3}" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the tangent value of the angle of depression is <InlineMath math="\frac{1}{3}" />.
