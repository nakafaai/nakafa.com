A coach is training <InlineMath math="3" /> students. The training involves jogging on a circular track. Jogging starts at <InlineMath math="07:00" /> from the start line. Below is the record of how long it takes for each runner to return to the start line.

| Runner | Returns to start line | Track length |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| <InlineMath math="A" /> | Every <InlineMath math="12" /> minutes | |
| <InlineMath math="B" /> | Every <InlineMath math="x" /> minutes | |
| <InlineMath math="C" /> | Every <InlineMath math="9" /> minutes | |

According to the coach's notes, until exactly <InlineMath math="09:24" />, the three runners have passed the start line together <InlineMath math="4" /> times.

If the average speed of runner <InlineMath math="A" /> is <InlineMath math="2" /> meters per second, then the length of the track is ....
