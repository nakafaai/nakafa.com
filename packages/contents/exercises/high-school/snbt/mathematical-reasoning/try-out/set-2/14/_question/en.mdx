A runner is training on a circular track. There are <InlineMath math="4" /> checkpoints on the track, namely <InlineMath math="A - B - C - D" />, with equal distance between checkpoints. Suppose the runner has passed checkpoint <InlineMath math="C" /> (starting from <InlineMath math="A" />) <InlineMath math="3" /> times in <InlineMath math="12" /> minutes.

However, suppose the distance from <InlineMath math="C" /> to <InlineMath math="D" /> is widened to <InlineMath math="2" /> times the original length. Then the time required for the runner to go from checkpoint <InlineMath math="A" /> to <InlineMath math="D" /> becomes...
