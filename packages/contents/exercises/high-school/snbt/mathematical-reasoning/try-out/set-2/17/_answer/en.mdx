**Initial Total Weight Analysis**

First, let's calculate the total body weight of each group before the swap. Group A has <InlineMath math="4" /> members with an average of <InlineMath math="30\text{ kg}" />. Group B has <InlineMath math="4" /> members with an average of <InlineMath math="33\text{ kg}" />.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total A} = 4 \times 30 = 120\text{ kg}" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total B} = 4 \times 33 = 132\text{ kg}" />
</MathContainer>

**The Swap Process**

Let the child leaving Group A be <InlineMath math="x_A" /> and the child leaving Group B be <InlineMath math="x_B" />. After swapping, <InlineMath math="x_A" /> joins Group B and <InlineMath math="x_B" /> joins Group A.

> For the averages of both groups to be equal after the swap (given the number of members remains the same), the **total body weight of both groups must also be equal**.

We can write this new balance equation as follows:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{New Total A} = \text{New Total B}" />
  <BlockMath math="120 - x_A + x_B = 132 - x_B + x_A" />
</MathContainer>

**Calculating the Difference**

Our goal is to find the difference in body weight between the two swapped children, which is <InlineMath math="|x_B - x_A|" />. We group the terms:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="x_B + x_B - x_A - x_A = 132 - 120" />
  <BlockMath math="2x_B - 2x_A = 12" />
  <BlockMath math="2(x_B - x_A) = 12" />
  <BlockMath math="x_B - x_A = 6" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the difference in body weight between the two swapped children is <InlineMath math="6\text{ kg}" />.
