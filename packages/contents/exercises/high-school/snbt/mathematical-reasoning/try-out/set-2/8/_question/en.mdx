A factory produces pans. Market demand for the pans continues to increase every month. To meet market needs, the factory continues to increase the number of pan production every month. The number of pans produced each month forms an arithmetic sequence. If the number of pans produced in the <InlineMath math="3\text{rd}" /> month is <InlineMath math="1,500" /> units, and in the <InlineMath math="6\text{th}" /> month it is <InlineMath math="2,250" /> units. In what month after the factory operates will the number of pan production exceed <InlineMath math="10,000" /> units per month?
