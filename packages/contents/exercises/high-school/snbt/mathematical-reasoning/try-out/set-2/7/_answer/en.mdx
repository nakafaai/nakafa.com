This problem can be solved using the concept of an **Arithmetic Sequence**, where Mr. Brikson's salary increases by a constant amount each year. We need to determine the starting term and the common difference based on the age and salary information.

**Analyzing the Information**

We know that this year, when Mr. Brikson is <InlineMath math="40" /> years old, his salary is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}15,750,000.00" />. The annual salary increase (common difference) is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}750,000.00" />.

We need to find his salary when he is <InlineMath math="54" /> years old.

**Calculating the Time Difference**

The first step is to calculate the time elapsed between the target age of <InlineMath math="54" /> years and the current age of <InlineMath math="40" /> years.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\Delta t = 54 - 40 = 14 \text{ years}" />
</MathContainer>

This implies that Mr. Brikson's salary will undergo <InlineMath math="14" /> increments.

**Calculating Salary at Age <InlineMath math="54" />**

The salary at age <InlineMath math="54" /> is determined by adding the accumulated increase over <InlineMath math="14" /> years to the base salary.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Salary}_{54} = \text{Salary}_{40} + (14 \times \text{Increase})" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Salary}_{54} = 15,750,000 + (14 \times 750,000)" />
</MathContainer>

Let's calculate the total increase:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="14 \times 750,000 = 10,500,000" />
</MathContainer>

So the total salary becomes:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Salary}_{54} = 15,750,000 + 10,500,000" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Salary}_{54} = 26,250,000" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, Mr. Brikson's monthly salary when he is <InlineMath math="54" /> years old will be <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}26,250,000.00" />.
