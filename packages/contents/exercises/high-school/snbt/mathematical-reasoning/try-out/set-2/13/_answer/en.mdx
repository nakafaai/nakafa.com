**Analyzing the Track**

The track is circular with the checkpoint sequence <InlineMath math="A \to B \to C \to D \to A" />. Since the distance between checkpoints is equal, we can count the number of segments the runner has traversed. Starting from <InlineMath math="A" />, the runner has passed checkpoint <InlineMath math="C" /> <InlineMath math="3" /> times.

1.  Reaching <InlineMath math="C" /> for the 1st time: <InlineMath math="A \to B \to C" /> (<InlineMath math="2" /> segments).
2.  Reaching <InlineMath math="C" /> for the 2nd time: <InlineMath math="C \to D \to A \to B \to C" /> (<InlineMath math="4" /> segments).
3.  Reaching <InlineMath math="C" /> for the 3rd time: <InlineMath math="C \to D \to A \to B \to C" /> (<InlineMath math="4" /> segments).

The total segments traversed is the sum of these stages.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Segments} = 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 \text{ segments}" />
</MathContainer>

**Calculating Time per Segment**

It is known that the time required to cover <InlineMath math="10" /> segments is <InlineMath math="12" /> minutes. We can determine the time taken for one segment.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Time per segment} = \frac{12}{10} = 1.2 \text{ minutes}" />
</MathContainer>

**Calculating Total Time to Reach C for the 4th Time**

To reach checkpoint <InlineMath math="C" /> for the fourth time, the runner must complete another full lap from their last position (at the 3rd <InlineMath math="C" />). The additional path is <InlineMath math="C \to D \to A \to B \to C" />, which consists of <InlineMath math="4" /> segments.

The additional time required is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Additional Time} = 4 \times 1.2 = 4.8 \text{ minutes}" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the total time from the start to reaching checkpoint <InlineMath math="C" /> for the fourth time is the sum of the initial time and the additional time.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Time} = 12 + 4.8 = 16.8 \text{ minutes}" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the time required is <InlineMath math="16.8" /> minutes.
