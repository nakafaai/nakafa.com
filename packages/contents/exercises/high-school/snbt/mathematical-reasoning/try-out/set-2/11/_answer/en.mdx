**Identifying the Information**

It is known that the total number of eggs in the box is <InlineMath math="40" />. Of these, <InlineMath math="3" /> are rotten. We are asked to find the probability of selecting a **non-rotten** egg.

**Calculating the Number of Non-Rotten Eggs**

The first step is to determine the number of favorable outcomes, which is selecting an egg in good condition. Since there are <InlineMath math="3" /> rotten eggs out of a total of <InlineMath math="40" />, the number of non-rotten eggs is the difference.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="n(\text{Non-Rotten}) = 40 - 3 = 37" />
</MathContainer>

**Calculating the Probability**

The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes (sample space).

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P(\text{Non-Rotten}) = \frac{n(\text{Non-Rotten})}{n(\text{Total})}" />
  <BlockMath math="P(\text{Non-Rotten}) = \frac{37}{40}" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the probability of selecting one non-rotten egg is <InlineMath math="\frac{37}{40}" />.
