A rocket is fired from an enemy base with the trajectory equation <InlineMath math="s(t) = 4000 - t^2" /> where <InlineMath math="s" /> is in meters and <InlineMath math="t" /> is in seconds. The rocket is intended to destroy an opposing aircraft carrier moving with the position function <InlineMath math="s(t) = 60t" />. The position when the rocket exactly hits the aircraft carrier is... Kilometers.
