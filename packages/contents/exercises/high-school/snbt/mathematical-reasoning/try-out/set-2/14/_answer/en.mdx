**Determining Time per Segment**

Based on the previous track analysis, it is known that to pass checkpoint <InlineMath math="C" /> <InlineMath math="3" /> times, the runner covers a total of <InlineMath math="10" /> normal track segments in <InlineMath math="12" /> minutes. Thus, the travel time for one normal segment is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="t_{\text{segment}} = \frac{12 \text{ minutes}}{10} = 1.2 \text{ minutes}" />
</MathContainer>

**Calculating Time for the New Path**

We are asked to find the travel time from <InlineMath math="A" /> to <InlineMath math="D" /> given that the distance from <InlineMath math="C" /> to <InlineMath math="D" /> is widened to <InlineMath math="2" /> times the original length.

The normal route from <InlineMath math="A" /> to <InlineMath math="D" /> follows the path:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="A \to B \to C \to D" />
</MathContainer>

The breakdown of segments is:
1.  <InlineMath math="A \to B" />: <InlineMath math="1" /> normal segment.
2.  <InlineMath math="B \to C" />: <InlineMath math="1" /> normal segment.
3.  <InlineMath math="C \to D" />: Since it is widened <InlineMath math="2" /> times, this is equivalent to <InlineMath math="2" /> normal segments.

The total effective segments to be covered is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Segments} = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \text{ segments}" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the total time required is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Time} = 4 \times 1.2 \text{ minutes} = 4.8 \text{ minutes}" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the time required for the runner to go from checkpoint <InlineMath math="A" /> to <InlineMath math="D" /> is <InlineMath math="4.8" /> minutes.
