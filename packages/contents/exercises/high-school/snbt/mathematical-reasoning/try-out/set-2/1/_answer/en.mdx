We are given three different land areas: <InlineMath math="120\text{ m}^2" />, <InlineMath math="180\text{ m}^2" />, and <InlineMath math="240\text{ m}^2" />. The goal is to divide these lands into plots of equal size, maximizing the area of each plot.

This problem can be solved by finding the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of the three numbers. The GCD will give us the largest value that evenly divides all three land areas.

First, we perform prime factorization for each area:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5" />
  <BlockMath math="180 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5" />
  <BlockMath math="240 = 2^4 \times 3 \times 5" />
</MathContainer>

To determine the GCD, we take the common prime factors with the **lowest exponent**:
- Factor 2: the lowest exponent is <InlineMath math="2^2" />.
- Factor 3: the lowest exponent is <InlineMath math="3^1" /> (or 3).
- Factor 5: the lowest exponent is <InlineMath math="5^1" /> (or 5).

Thus, the GCD is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{GCD} = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{GCD} = 4 \times 3 \times 5" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{GCD} = 60" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the largest possible area for each plot of land is <InlineMath math="60\text{ m}^2" />.
