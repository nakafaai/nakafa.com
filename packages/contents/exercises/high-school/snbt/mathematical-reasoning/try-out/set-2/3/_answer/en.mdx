We are given information regarding the original price of the motorcycle, the discount percentage, and the tax applied to that discount.

Given:
- Original price = <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}75,000,000.00" />
- Discount = <InlineMath math="10\%" />
- Tax on discount = <InlineMath math="2.5\%" />

First, we calculate the discount amount:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Discount Amount} = 10\% \times 75,000,000" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Discount Amount} = 7,500,000" />
</MathContainer>

Next, we calculate the price of the motorcycle after the discount (before tax):

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Price After Discount} = 75,000,000 - 7,500,000" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Price After Discount} = 67,500,000" />
</MathContainer>

The problem states that there is a <InlineMath math="2.5\%" /> tax applied **on the discount**. This means we calculate <InlineMath math="2.5\%" /> of the discount amount (<InlineMath math="\text{Rp}7,500,000.00" />) and add it to the payable amount.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Tax} = 2.5\% \times 7,500,000" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Tax} = \frac{2.5}{100} \times 7,500,000" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Tax} = 187,500" />
</MathContainer>

Finally, we calculate the total price the Father has to pay by adding the price after discount and the tax:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Pay} = \text{Price After Discount} + \text{Tax}" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Pay} = 67,500,000 + 187,500" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Pay} = 67,687,500" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the final motorcycle price the Father has to pay is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp}67,687,500.00" />.
