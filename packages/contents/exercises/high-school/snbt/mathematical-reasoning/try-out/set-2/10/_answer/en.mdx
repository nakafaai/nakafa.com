**Analyzing Probability for the First Box**

In the first box, there are a total of <InlineMath math="4 + 3 = 7" /> balls. We want to draw a red ball, of which there are <InlineMath math="4" />. The probability of drawing a red ball from the first box is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P(\text{Red}_1) = \frac{n(\text{Red}_1)}{n(S_1)} = \frac{4}{7}" />
</MathContainer>

**Analyzing Probability for the Second Box**

In the second box, there are a total of <InlineMath math="7 + 3 = 10" /> balls. We want to draw a white ball, of which there are <InlineMath math="3" />. The probability of drawing a white ball from the second box is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P(\text{White}_2) = \frac{n(\text{White}_2)}{n(S_2)} = \frac{3}{10}" />
</MathContainer>

**Calculating the Combined Probability**

Since drawing balls from the two boxes are **independent events** (the event in the first box does not affect the second box), the probability of both events occurring together is calculated by multiplying their individual probabilities.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P(\text{Total}) = P(\text{Red}_1) \times P(\text{White}_2)" />
  <BlockMath math="P(\text{Total}) = \frac{4}{7} \times \frac{3}{10}" />
  <BlockMath math="P(\text{Total}) = \frac{12}{70}" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the probability of drawing a red ball from the first box and a white ball from the second box is <InlineMath math="\frac{12}{70}" />.
