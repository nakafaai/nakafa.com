**Strategy to Minimize Average**

To find the **smallest possible average** score, we must make every participant's score as low as possible while strictly adhering to the constraints given in the problem.

We have a total of <InlineMath math="60" /> participants divided into two groups based on the information provided:
1. First group: <InlineMath math="21" /> participants with scores <InlineMath math="\geq 80" />.
2. Second group: The remaining <InlineMath math="60 - 21 = 39" /> participants with scores <InlineMath math="< 80" />.

**Determining Minimum Scores for Each Group**

To minimize the total sum (and consequently the average), we assign the lowest possible scores to each group:

*   **For the 21 participants (scores <InlineMath math="\geq 80" />):** The smallest value satisfying this condition is exactly <InlineMath math="80" />. We assume all <InlineMath math="21" /> people scored exactly <InlineMath math="80" />.
*   **For the other 39 participants (scores <InlineMath math="< 80" />):** Since the score range is <InlineMath math="0" /> to <InlineMath math="100" />, the lowest possible score they can get is <InlineMath math="0" />. We assume all <InlineMath math="39" /> people scored <InlineMath math="0" />.

**Calculating the Smallest Average**

Now we calculate the average based on this minimum score scenario:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\bar{x}_{\text{min}} = \frac{(21 \times 80) + (39 \times 0)}{60}" />
  <BlockMath math="\bar{x}_{\text{min}} = \frac{1,680 + 0}{60}" />
  <BlockMath math="\bar{x}_{\text{min}} = \frac{1,680}{60}" />
  <BlockMath math="\bar{x}_{\text{min}} = 28" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the smallest possible average score for the 60 participants is <InlineMath math="28" />.
