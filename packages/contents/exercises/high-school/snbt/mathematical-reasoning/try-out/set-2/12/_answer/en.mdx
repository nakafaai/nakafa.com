**Determining the Time of Impact**

The impact occurs when both objects are at the same position. Therefore, we need to equate the position equations of the rocket and the aircraft carrier to find the time of the event.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="s_{rocket}(t) = s_{carrier}(t)" />
  <BlockMath math="4000 - t^2 = 60t" />
  <BlockMath math="t^2 + 60t - 4000 = 0" />
</MathContainer>

Next, we factor the quadratic equation to find the value of <InlineMath math="t" />.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="(t + 100)(t - 40) = 0" />
</MathContainer>

From the factorization above, we obtain two solutions: <InlineMath math="t = -100" /> or <InlineMath math="t = 40" />. Since time cannot be negative, we take the positive value.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="t = 40 \text{ seconds}" />
</MathContainer>

**Calculating the Position of Impact**

After finding the time of impact, we can calculate the position by substituting <InlineMath math="t = 40" /> into either position equation. We use the aircraft carrier's equation as it is simpler.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="s(40) = 60(40)" />
  <BlockMath math="s(40) = 2400 \text{ meters}" />
</MathContainer>

Finally, we convert the unit from meters to kilometers.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="2400 \text{ meters} = 2.4 \text{ km}" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the position when the rocket exactly hits the aircraft carrier is <InlineMath math="2.4" /> km.
