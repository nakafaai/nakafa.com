The television price before tax is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp }4,500,000.00" />. A <InlineMath math="10\%" /> tax is applied to the base price, so the tax amount is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp }450,000.00" />. After tax, the price becomes <InlineMath math="\text{Rp }4,950,000.00" />.

The <InlineMath math="5\%" /> discount is applied to the taxed price, so the discount amount is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp }247,500.00" />. The amount that must be paid is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Rp }4,950,000.00 - \text{Rp }247,500.00 = \text{Rp }4,702,500.00" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the amount Mrs. Juju must pay is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp }4,702,500.00" />.
