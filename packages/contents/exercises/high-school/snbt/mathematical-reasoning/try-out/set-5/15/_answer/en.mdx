Let <InlineMath math="B" /> be Bimo's current age and <InlineMath math="A" /> be his Father's current age. We will translate the verbal information from the problem into a precise mathematical model.

First, let's analyze the past condition: "Six years ago, Bimo's age was <InlineMath math="4" /> years younger than one-sixth of his Father's age." This sentence can be written as the following equation:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="(B - 6) = \frac{1}{6}(A - 6) - 4" />
</MathContainer>

Second, let's analyze the current condition: "Bimo's current age is <InlineMath math="3" /> years older than one-eighth of his Father's age." This statement yields the second equation:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="B = \frac{1}{8}A + 3" />
</MathContainer>

Now we have a system of linear equations with two variables. The next step is to simplify the first equation to make it easier to work with. We will eliminate the fractions and group the variables:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{aligned}
B - 6 &= \frac{1}{6}(A - 6) - 4 \\
B - 2 &= \frac{1}{6}(A - 6) \\
6(B - 2) &= A - 6 \\
6B - 12 &= A - 6 \\
6B - A &= 6 \quad \dots(1)
\end{aligned}" />
</MathContainer>

Next, we modify the second equation to have a form consistent with equation <InlineMath math="(1)" /> to facilitate the elimination process:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{aligned}
B &= \frac{1}{8}A + 3 \\
8B &= A + 24 \\
8B - A &= 24 \quad \dots(2)
\end{aligned}" />
</MathContainer>

With two neat linear equations, we can eliminate variable <InlineMath math="A" /> by subtracting equation <InlineMath math="(1)" /> from equation <InlineMath math="(2)" />:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{aligned}
(8B - A) - (6B - A) &= 24 - 6 \\
2B &= 18 \\
\therefore B &= 9
\end{aligned}" />
</MathContainer>

Having found that Bimo is <InlineMath math="9" /> years old, we substitute the value of <InlineMath math="B" /> into equation <InlineMath math="(1)" /> to find the Father's age:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{aligned}
6(9) - A &= 6 \\
54 - A &= 6 \\
A &= 54 - 6 \\
\therefore A &= 48
\end{aligned}" />
</MathContainer>

Finally, we calculate the sum of Bimo's and his Father's current ages:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="A + B = 48 + 9 = 57" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the sum of their ages is 57 years.
