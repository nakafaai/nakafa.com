We will use the multiplication rule (*filling slots*) to form the two-digit house numbers.

**Identifying Available Digits**

Whole numbers less than <InlineMath math="10" /> are <InlineMath math="\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}" />. The condition is that **all digits must be odd**. Therefore, the allowed digits are:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}" />
</MathContainer>

There are <InlineMath math="5" /> odd digits available. Since the house number consists of two digits, we have two positions to fill:

1.  **First Digit**: Can be chosen from the <InlineMath math="5" /> odd digits.
2.  **Second Digit**: Can also be chosen from the <InlineMath math="5" /> odd digits (repetition is allowed).

**Calculating Total Possibilities**

The total number of possibilities is the product of the choices for each position:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = 5 \times 5 = 25" />
</MathContainer>

So, there are <InlineMath math="25" /> possible house numbers.
