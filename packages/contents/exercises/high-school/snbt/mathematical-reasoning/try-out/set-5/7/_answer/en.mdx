We use the concept of the mean (average) value (<InlineMath math="\bar{x}" />), which is defined as the sum of all data values (<InlineMath math="\Sigma x" />) divided by the number of data points (<InlineMath math="n" />).

**Initial Condition**

Initially, there are <InlineMath math="39" /> students with an average score of <InlineMath math="45" />. Their total score is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\Sigma x_1 = \bar{x}_1 \cdot n_1" />
  <BlockMath math="\Sigma x_1 = 45 \times 39 = 1755" />
</MathContainer>

**After Yanto Joins**

When Yanto joins, the number of students increases to <InlineMath math="n_2 = 39 + 1 = 40" />. The new class average becomes <InlineMath math="46" />. The new total score is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\Sigma x_2 = \bar{x}_2 \cdot n_2" />
  <BlockMath math="\Sigma x_2 = 46 \times 40 = 1840" />
</MathContainer>

**Finding Yanto's Score**

Yanto's score (<InlineMath math="Y" />) is the difference between the new total score and the initial total score.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="Y = \Sigma x_2 - \Sigma x_1" />
  <BlockMath math="Y = 1840 - 1755" />
  <BlockMath math="Y = 85" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, Yanto's exam score is <InlineMath math="85" />.
