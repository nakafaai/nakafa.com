To determine when all three suppliers deliver vegetables simultaneously, we use the concept of the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of their delivery schedules, which are <InlineMath math="x" />, <InlineMath math="4" />, and <InlineMath math="7" />.

It is given that the <InlineMath math="16" />-th simultaneous delivery occurs <InlineMath math="1260" /> days after the first delivery. This means that <InlineMath math="15" /> simultaneous delivery intervals have passed since the first meeting.

We can calculate the LCM of the three numbers by dividing the total number of days by the number of intervals occurred:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{LCM} = \frac{1260}{16 - 1} = \frac{1260}{15} = 84 \text{ days}" />
</MathContainer>

So, the LCM of <InlineMath math="x" />, <InlineMath math="4" />, and <InlineMath math="7" /> is <InlineMath math="84" />. We know that the LCM of <InlineMath math="4" /> and <InlineMath math="7" /> is <InlineMath math="28" />. Therefore, we must find the value of <InlineMath math="x" /> such that the LCM of <InlineMath math="x" /> and <InlineMath math="28" /> is <InlineMath math="84" />.

Let's check the available options:
- If <InlineMath math="x = 6" />, then LCM(<InlineMath math="6, 28" />) = <InlineMath math="84" />. (Correct)
- If <InlineMath math="x = 8" />, then LCM(<InlineMath math="8, 28" />) = <InlineMath math="56" />. (Incorrect)
- If <InlineMath math="x = 9" />, then LCM(<InlineMath math="9, 28" />) = <InlineMath math="252" />. (Incorrect)
- If <InlineMath math="x = 10" />, then LCM(<InlineMath math="10, 28" />) = <InlineMath math="140" />. (Incorrect)
- If <InlineMath math="x = 11" />, then LCM(<InlineMath math="11, 28" />) = <InlineMath math="308" />. (Incorrect)

Thus, the value of <InlineMath math="x" /> that satisfies the condition is <InlineMath math="6" />.
