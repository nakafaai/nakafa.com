We will calculate the total weight of vegetables received by Pak Saiful from Supplier B in April and May <InlineMath math="2024" />, and then find the difference.

In April <InlineMath math="2024" />, Supplier B delivers vegetables every <InlineMath math="4" /> days with a weight of <InlineMath math="12" /> kg per shipment. The delivery schedule starts on April <InlineMath math="1" />, so the delivery dates are:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\{1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29\}" />
</MathContainer>

There are <InlineMath math="8" /> deliveries in April. Thus, the total weight is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total April} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ kg}" />
</MathContainer>

Next, for May <InlineMath math="2024" />, the weight per shipment increases to <InlineMath math="20" /> kg. April has <InlineMath math="30" /> days. Since the last delivery was on April <InlineMath math="29" />, the next delivery (<InlineMath math="4" /> days later) falls on May <InlineMath math="3" />. The delivery dates in May are:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\{3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31\}" />
</MathContainer>

There are also <InlineMath math="8" /> deliveries in May. Thus, the total weight is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total May} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ kg}" />
</MathContainer>

The difference in vegetable weight received between May and April is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Difference} = \text{Total May} - \text{Total April}" />
  <BlockMath math="= 160 - 96" />
  <BlockMath math="= 64 \text{ kg}" />
</MathContainer>

So, the difference in weight is <InlineMath math="64" /> kg.
