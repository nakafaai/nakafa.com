We need to calculate the total loan amount after interest, then divide it by the repayment period to find the monthly installment.

First, calculate the total interest percentage for the loan period. Since the interest is given per year (<InlineMath math="12" /> months) and the loan duration is <InlineMath math="15" /> months, the time proportion is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\frac{15}{12} \times 16\% = 1.25 \times 16\% = 20\%" />
</MathContainer>

Next, calculate the nominal interest in Rupiah based on the principal loan of <InlineMath math="Rp4,500,000.00" />:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Interest} = 20\% \times 4,500,000 = 900,000" />
</MathContainer>

The total amount to be repaid is the sum of the principal and the interest:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = 4,500,000 + 900,000 = 5,400,000" />
</MathContainer>

Finally, divide the total loan by the repayment period (<InlineMath math="15" /> months) to get the monthly installment:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Installment} = \frac{5,400,000}{15} = 360,000" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, Zul must pay <InlineMath math="Rp360,000.00" /> each month.
