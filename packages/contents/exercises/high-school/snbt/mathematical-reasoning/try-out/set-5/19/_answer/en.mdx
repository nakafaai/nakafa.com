We will determine the values of <InlineMath math="a" /> and <InlineMath math="b" /> based on how linear transformations affect the mean and range of a dataset.

Let the initial mean be <InlineMath math="\bar{x}_1 = 5" /> and the initial range be <InlineMath math="R_1 = 4" />. The data transformation involves multiplying each value by <InlineMath math="a" /> and then adding <InlineMath math="b" />.

**Analysis of Range Change**

The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Adding a constant <InlineMath math="b" /> shifts all data points equally, so the difference remains unchanged. However, multiplying by <InlineMath math="a" /> scales the range. Since the range is always positive:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="R_2 = |a| \cdot R_1" />
</MathContainer>

Given the new range <InlineMath math="R_2 = 12" /> and the old range <InlineMath math="R_1 = 4" />. Assuming <InlineMath math="a" /> is positive in this context:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="12 = a \cdot 4" />
  <BlockMath math="a = \frac{12}{4} = 3" />
</MathContainer>

**Analysis of Mean Change**

The mean is affected by both multiplication and addition. The transformation formula for the mean is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\bar{x}_2 = a \cdot \bar{x}_1 + b" />
</MathContainer>

Substitute the known values (<InlineMath math="\bar{x}_2 = 19" />, <InlineMath math="\bar{x}_1 = 5" />, and <InlineMath math="a = 3" />):

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="19 = 3(5) + b" />
  <BlockMath math="19 = 15 + b" />
  <BlockMath math="b = 19 - 15 = 4" />
</MathContainer>

**Calculating the Final Value**

The question asks for the value of <InlineMath math="3a - b" />:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="3a - b = 3(3) - 4" />
  <BlockMath math="3a - b = 9 - 4 = 5" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the value of <InlineMath math="3a - b" /> is <InlineMath math="5" />.
