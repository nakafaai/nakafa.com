To determine the selling price of the mixture, we need to know the total capital expenditure and the total weight of the rice obtained. Let's calculate this step-by-step using the concept of weighted average.

The total capital is the sum of the purchase costs for rice type A and type B:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Capital} = (20 \times 10,000) + (30 \times 12,000)" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Capital} = 200,000 + 360,000" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Capital} = 560,000" />
</MathContainer>

The total weight of the rice after mixing is <InlineMath math="20 + 30 = 50" /> kg. From this, we can calculate the cost price per kilogram of the mixed rice:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Cost Price} = \frac{\text{Total Capital}}{\text{Total Weight}}" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Cost Price} = \frac{560,000}{50} = 11,200" />
</MathContainer>

The merchant wants a profit of <InlineMath math="10\%" />. This means the selling price per kg is the cost price plus the profit, or equivalent to <InlineMath math="110\%" /> of the cost price.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} \times (1 + \text{Profit Percentage})" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Selling Price} = 11,200 \times (1 + 0.1)" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Selling Price} = 11,200 \times 1.1" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Selling Price} = 12,320" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the selling price of the mixed rice per kg to achieve a <InlineMath math="10\%" /> profit is <InlineMath math="\text{Rp12,320.00}" />.
