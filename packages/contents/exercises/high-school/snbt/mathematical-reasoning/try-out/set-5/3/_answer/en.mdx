Supplier C delivers on days <InlineMath math="1, 8, 15, 22, 29" /> for a total of <InlineMath math="5" /> deliveries.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ kg}" />
  <BlockMath math="5 \times 30 = 150 \text{ kg}" />
  <BlockMath math="96 + 150 = 246 \text{ kg}" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the total weight from suppliers B and C during April <InlineMath math="2024" /> is <InlineMath math="246 \text{ kg}" />.
