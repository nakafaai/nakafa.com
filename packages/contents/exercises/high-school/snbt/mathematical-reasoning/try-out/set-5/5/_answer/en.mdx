The initial number of bacteria on day one is <InlineMath math="10" />. The population doubles every day, while every <InlineMath math="120" /> hours (every <InlineMath math="5" /> days) half of the total is killed before the next growth cycle continues.

After the first <InlineMath math="4" /> days, the count becomes <InlineMath math="10 \times 2^4 = 160" />. On day <InlineMath math="5" />, half are killed, leaving <InlineMath math="80" />. From day <InlineMath math="6" /> to day <InlineMath math="9" />, the population doubles each day, giving <InlineMath math="80 \times 2^4 = 1280" />. On day <InlineMath math="10" />, half are killed again, leaving <InlineMath math="640" />. Over the next two days, the population doubles back to <InlineMath math="640 \times 2^2 = 1280" />.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="10 \rightarrow 160 \rightarrow 80 \rightarrow 1280 \rightarrow 640 \rightarrow 1280" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the number of bacteria on day <InlineMath math="12" /> is <InlineMath math="1280" />.
