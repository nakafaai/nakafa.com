The core concept here is maintaining the **consistency of the tea's taste**. For the tea to taste the same, the ratio between tea bags and sugar must remain constant, regardless of how many glasses are made.

The base ratio is given as <InlineMath math="2" /> tea bags to <InlineMath math="3" /> spoons of sugar. When we use <InlineMath math="5" /> tea bags with <InlineMath math="b" /> spoons of sugar, we can set up the following proportion:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\frac{\text{Tea}}{\text{Sugar}} \Rightarrow \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{b}" />
</MathContainer>

Our goal is to find the value of <InlineMath math="P" />, which is defined as <InlineMath math="2b" />. By observing the proportion closely, we can solve directly for <InlineMath math="2b" /> using cross-multiplication, without needing to find the individual value of <InlineMath math="b" /> first:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="2 \cdot b = 5 \cdot 3" />
  <BlockMath math="2b = 15" />
</MathContainer>

Now we have <InlineMath math="P = 15" />. We simply compare this with the given value of <InlineMath math="Q" />, which is <InlineMath math="10" />.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P = 15" />
  <BlockMath math="Q = 10" />
  <BlockMath math="\therefore 15 > 10 \implies P > Q" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, we can conclude that the correct relationship is <InlineMath math="P" /> is greater than <InlineMath math="Q" />.
