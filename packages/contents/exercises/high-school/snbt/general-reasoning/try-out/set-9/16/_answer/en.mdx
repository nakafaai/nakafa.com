Based on the information in paragraph 1, it is clearly stated that **"These floods transport important nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter, to the surrounding soil."**

This sentence directly supports the statement that seasonal floods transport many important nutrients to the surrounding soil. The other options are incorrect because:
- Nitrogen and phosphorus are described as "important nutrients," not harmful ones.
- Organic matter is not stated to be obtainable "only" during floods (the word "only" makes it false).
- The soil's need for man-made floods is not discussed.
- Soil fertility is not limited to "only" occurring during the flood season.

Therefore, the true statement according to paragraph 1 is that seasonal floods transport important nutrients.
