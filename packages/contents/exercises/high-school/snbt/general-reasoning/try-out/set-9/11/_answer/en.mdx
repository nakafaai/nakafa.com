Based on the information in the text, we can set up the mathematical equations as follows:

1.  The total number of votes is <InlineMath math="100,000" />.
2.  Candidate <InlineMath math="A" /> received half the votes of Candidate <InlineMath math="B" />, so <InlineMath math="A = \frac{1}{2}B" /> or <InlineMath math="B = 2A" />.
3.  Candidate <InlineMath math="C" /> received <InlineMath math="10,000" /> votes.

We can calculate the votes received by Candidate <InlineMath math="A" /> using the total votes equation:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="A + B + C = 100,000" />
</MathContainer>

Substitute <InlineMath math="B = 2A" /> and <InlineMath math="C = 10,000" /> into the equation:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="A + 2A + 10,000 = 100,000" />
  <BlockMath math="3A = 100,000 - 10,000" />
  <BlockMath math="3A = 90,000" />
  <BlockMath math="A = \frac{90,000}{3}" />
  <BlockMath math="A = 30,000" />
</MathContainer>

> So, Candidate <InlineMath math="A" /> received **<InlineMath math="30" /> thousand** votes.
