The correct answer is the statement:

> *"If fish in the tropics do not move towards the poles to find a cooler place then there is no rise in ocean temperature"*

This statement is **TRUE** based on the logical principle of **Modus Tollens** (Contrapositive).

**Logical Analysis:**

Based on paragraph 3, there is an implication statement (cause-and-effect): "Rising ocean temperatures cause fish in tropical regions to move towards the poles to find cooler places."

Let's symbolize this:

*   <InlineMath math="P" /> = Rising ocean temperatures occur.
*   <InlineMath math="Q" /> = Fish in tropical regions move towards the poles.

The logical form is: <InlineMath math="P \rightarrow Q" />.

In mathematical logic, an implication <InlineMath math="P \rightarrow Q" /> is equivalent to its **contrapositive**, which is <InlineMath math="\sim Q \rightarrow \sim P" />.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P \rightarrow Q \equiv \sim Q \rightarrow \sim P" />
</MathContainer>

This means: "If fish in tropical regions **do not move** towards the poles (<InlineMath math="\sim Q" />), then rising ocean temperatures **did not occur** (<InlineMath math="\sim P" />)."

This choice matches the contrapositive form, so it is logically **TRUE**.

Meanwhile, the other options contain logical fallacies such as the inverse (<InlineMath math="\sim P \rightarrow \sim Q" />) or converse (<InlineMath math="Q \rightarrow P" />) which are not necessarily true.
