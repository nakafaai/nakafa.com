This sequence follows the Fibonacci pattern, where each term (starting from the third term) is the sum of the two preceding terms. Let's check the pattern:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{aligned} 3 + 6 &= 9 \\ 6 + 9 &= 15 \\ 9 + 15 &= 24 \\ 15 + 24 &= 39 \end{aligned}" />
</MathContainer>

To find the next term after <InlineMath math="39" />, we add the last two known terms:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="24 + 39 = 63" />
</MathContainer>

We can verify this result by calculating the subsequent terms:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{aligned} 39 + 63 &= 102 \\ 63 + 102 &= 165 \end{aligned}" />
</MathContainer>

Both verification results match the final terms in the given sequence.

Thus, the correct number to complete the sequence is <InlineMath math="63" />.
