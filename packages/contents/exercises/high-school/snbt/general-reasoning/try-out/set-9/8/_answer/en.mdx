Based on the conditions described in the reading, the requirements to be recommended as a people's representative in city A are:
1.  **Must have completed a bachelor's degree**.
2.  **Must be committed to the welfare of the people**.

Facts about Surya currently:
*   Has a commitment to the welfare of the people (Meets requirement 2).
*   **Has not yet completed a bachelor's degree** (Does not meet requirement 1).

Because Surya does not meet one of the absolute requirements (not yet a bachelor), he does not meet the qualifications to be recommended.

> So, the conclusion that Surya is definitely recommended as a people's representative in city A is **definitely false**.
