Researchers studying climate change have observed how biological and physical changes on Earth due to climate change will alter food production and impact human health. In terms of quantity, various studies have found that a combination of increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, rising temperatures, and changing rainfall patterns can impact the decline in agricultural yields such as corn, rice, and wheat. This impact mainly occurs in tropical regions, which normally have high food production.

Temperature increases due to climate change also tend to increase plant pests. "Currently, pests are responsible for the loss of 25 to 40 percent of food crops, and if climate change continues, these pests will be able to expand their range," said Myers. Insects will also likely move to areas where insects were previously never found. Consequently, plants that have not evolved to develop defenses against insects will also be impacted. In addition, pest predators such as birds may change their migration times due to climate change and result in pest population explosions.

In addition, other food sources such as fish will decrease in quantity. Rising ocean temperatures cause fish in tropical regions to move towards the poles to find cooler places. The decline in food production in equatorial regions raises concerns, because almost all human population growth in the next 50 years is predicted to occur in tropical regions.
