To determine the relationship between the survey results and statements A and B, we need to identify the main topic of each statement:

*   **Statement A** discusses the effect of **seasons** (rainy vs. dry) on harvest yield.
*   **Statement B** discusses the effect of **fertilizer type** (manure vs. compost) on harvest yield.

The survey specifically states that **"mango tree productivity increases when using manure"**.

This fact directly supports the claim in statement B that says using manure produces more fruit. Since the survey results align with and prove the validity of argument B, the survey serves to **strengthen statement B**. The survey does not discuss seasons, so it is irrelevant to statement A.
