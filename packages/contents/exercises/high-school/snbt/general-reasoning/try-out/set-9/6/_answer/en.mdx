The most appropriate answer is **Irrelevant to statements A and B**.

To determine the relationship between the data and the statements, let's break down the main topic of each point:

1.  **Statement A**: Discusses environmental conditions (**high air pollution** & **clean water**).
2.  **Statement B**: Discusses industrial activities causing **river pollution**.
3.  **Data**: Discusses the increase in **public transportation usage** caused by **economic factors (price) and accessibility**.

**Relevance Analysis:**

The presented data only explains transportation trends and their direct causes (price & access). This data **does not provide information** regarding the impact of transportation on air pollution (whether it decreases or increases) or river conditions.

Therefore, the data stands alone and has no direct causal relationship that strengthens or weakens the environmental conditions mentioned in A or the industrial activities in B.

> **Conclusion:** The transportation data discusses a different topic (economic/social) compared to statements A and B (environmental/industrial), so it is considered **irrelevant**.
