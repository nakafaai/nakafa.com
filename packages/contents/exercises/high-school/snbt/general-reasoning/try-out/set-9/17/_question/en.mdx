Besides bringing danger, floods also bring nutrients and important components for life. Seasonal floods can renew ecosystems and help the surrounding soil environment become more fertile. These floods transport important nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter, to the surrounding soil.

When the water recedes after a seasonal flood, it leaves sediment and nutrients on the floodplain which become natural fertilizer. This rich natural fertilizer improves soil quality and has a positive impact on plant growth, thereby increasing ecosystem productivity. Ancient civilizations first appeared along river deltas that flooded seasonally, such as the Nile River in Egypt, because they provided fertile soil for agricultural land.
