The correct answer is the statement:

> *"If climate change does not occur, then there is no impact on changes in food production or human health"*

This statement is **NOT TRUE** because it contains a logical fallacy.

**Logical Analysis:**

The text states that **climate change** (<InlineMath math="P" />) causes **impacts on food/health** (<InlineMath math="Q" />). Logically: <InlineMath math="P \rightarrow Q" />.

The statement above reverses this logic (inverse): if there is **no climate change** (<InlineMath math="\sim P" />), then there is **no impact** (<InlineMath math="\sim Q" />).

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\sim P \rightarrow \sim Q" />
</MathContainer>

This is incorrect because an **implication is not equivalent to its inverse**. Something else (other than climate change) could still cause those impacts.

Meanwhile, the other options are **TRUE** as they correspond directly to information explicitly stated in the text.
