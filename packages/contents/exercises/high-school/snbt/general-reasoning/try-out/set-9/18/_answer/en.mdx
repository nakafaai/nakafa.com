To find the statement that is **definitely false**, we need to compare each option with the information presented in the text. The text outlines two main paths:
1.  Students who **drop out** <InlineMath math="\rightarrow" /> start working to earn money.
2.  Students who **do not drop out** <InlineMath math="\rightarrow" /> continue to higher education at universities and tend to live prosperously.

The statement that **"Students who continue to higher education are students who belong to the dropout category"** directly contradicts the information above. The text explicitly associates "continuing to higher education" with students who do **not** drop out. Therefore, claiming that university students are dropouts is a clear contradiction.

The other options are statements that are true or at least consistent with the text: students who go to college are indeed not dropouts, prosperous people are usually university graduates, and dropouts work (rather than go to college).
