Based on the information in paragraph 2, specifically the last sentence, it is stated that:

**"Ancient civilizations first appeared along river deltas that flooded seasonally, such as the Nile River in Egypt, because they provided fertile soil for agricultural land."**

This statement clearly implies a causal relationship: seasonal floods in the Nile River caused the soil to become fertile, which then supported agricultural land.

Therefore, the claim that **"The fertility of agricultural land in the Nile River delta is not affected by seasonal floods"** is **false** and directly contradicts the information in the text. The other options are true statements according to the passage.
