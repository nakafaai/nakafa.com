To determine the number of students on the 7th day, let's analyze the pattern of library visitors over the six days.

Visitor data: <InlineMath math="120, 123, 121, 124, 122, 125" />.

#### Pattern Analysis

Let's observe the difference between each consecutive term:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="120 \xrightarrow{+3} 123 \xrightarrow{-2} 121 \xrightarrow{+3} 124 \xrightarrow{-2} 122 \xrightarrow{+3} 125" />
</MathContainer>

The addition pattern repeats alternately: <InlineMath math="+3, -2, +3, -2, +3" />.

Based on this pattern, the next step is <InlineMath math="-2" />.

#### Calculation

The number of students on the 7th day is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="125 - 2 = 123" />
</MathContainer>

#### Conclusion

Therefore, the number of students visiting the library on the 7th day is estimated to be <InlineMath math="123" /> students.
