Based on the text, it is stated that **"Receding floodwaters can create stagnant water pools, which become perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which can transmit malaria"**.

This implies a direct causal relationship: the more stagnant water pools (due to receding floods), the more breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and consequently, the **higher** the potential for malaria transmission.

The option stating that "the more stagnant water pools... the **lower** the potential for malaria" clearly contradicts the logic of the text. Therefore, this statement is **NOT TRUE**.
