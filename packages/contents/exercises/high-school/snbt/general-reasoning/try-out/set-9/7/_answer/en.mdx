Based on the information in the reading, the best time to visit Bromo is only during the dry season in May and June.

This means, if currently it is February (not May or June), then currently is not the best time to visit the Bromo Area.

> So, the conclusion that currently is not the best time to visit the Bromo Tourism Area is **definitely true**.
