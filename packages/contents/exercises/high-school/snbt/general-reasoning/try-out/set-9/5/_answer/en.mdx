The statement that is **DEFINITELY FALSE** is:

> *"Prone sleeping only has bad impacts for someone who has snoring problems during sleep."*

This statement directly contradicts the information in the text. The text explicitly states that **prone sleeping can reduce snoring** because it prevents the tongue from blocking the airway.

This is a **benefit (good impact)** for people who snore. Therefore, claiming that this position *only* has bad impacts is false, as there is a positive impact explicitly mentioned.
