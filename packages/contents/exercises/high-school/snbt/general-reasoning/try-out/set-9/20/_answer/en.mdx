Based on the information in the passage, School A sets three absolute requirements for students to receive an overseas scholarship:
1.  Have excellent grades.
2.  Have no record of misconduct.
3.  Be approved by at least <InlineMath math="70\%" /> of the teachers.

Ali meets the requirement for excellent grades, but he is **only approved by <InlineMath math="50\%" /> of the teachers**.

Since one requirement is not met (the percentage of teacher approval is less than <InlineMath math="70\%" />), Ali automatically does not meet the criteria to receive the scholarship. Therefore, the conclusion stating that Ali is not eligible for the scholarship is **definitely true**.
