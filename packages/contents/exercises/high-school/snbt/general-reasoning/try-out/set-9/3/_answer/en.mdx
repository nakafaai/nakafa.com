The correct answer is the statement:

> *"If plant pests do not increase then the temperature rise due to climate change did not occur"*

This statement is **TRUE** based on the logical principle of **Modus Tollens** (Contrapositive).

**Logical Analysis:**

Based on paragraph 2, there is an implication statement (cause-and-effect): "Temperature increases due to climate change tend to increase plant pests."

Let's symbolize this:

*   <InlineMath math="P" /> = Temperature rise due to climate change occurs.
*   <InlineMath math="Q" /> = Plant pests increase.

The logical form is: <InlineMath math="P \rightarrow Q" />.

In mathematical logic, an implication <InlineMath math="P \rightarrow Q" /> is equivalent to its **contrapositive**, which is <InlineMath math="\sim Q \rightarrow \sim P" />.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P \rightarrow Q \equiv \sim Q \rightarrow \sim P" />
</MathContainer>

This means: "If plant pests **do not increase** (<InlineMath math="\sim Q" />), then the temperature rise due to climate change **did not occur** (<InlineMath math="\sim P" />)."

This choice matches the contrapositive form, so it is logically **TRUE**.

Meanwhile, the other options contain logical fallacies such as the inverse (<InlineMath math="\sim P \rightarrow \sim Q" />) or converse (<InlineMath math="Q \rightarrow P" />) which are not necessarily true.
