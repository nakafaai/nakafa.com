Rara takes toys from two different boxes. The number of toys in each box is presented in the following table:

| Box <InlineMath math="1" /> | Box <InlineMath math="2" /> | Toy |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| <InlineMath math="3" /> | <InlineMath math="4" /> | Teddy bear |
| <InlineMath math="4" /> | <InlineMath math="3" /> | Barbie doll |
| <InlineMath math="5" /> | <InlineMath math="4" /> | Ball |
| <InlineMath math="4" /> | <InlineMath math="4" /> | Marbles |

If Rara is going to take one toy from Box <InlineMath math="1" /> and one toy from Box <InlineMath math="2" />, which combination is she most likely to get?
