To determine which combination is most likely to be obtained, we need to calculate the probability of each option.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys in each box:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Box 1} = 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 16" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Box 2} = 4 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 15" />
</MathContainer>

The probability of taking a specific toy is the number of those toys divided by the total number of toys in that box. Since taking from Box <InlineMath math="1" /> and Box <InlineMath math="2" /> are independent events, we multiply their probabilities.

Let's analyze each option:

#### Probability Analysis

| Option | Probability Calculation | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **2 Teddy Bears** | <InlineMath math="\frac{3}{16} \times \frac{4}{15}" /> | <InlineMath math="\frac{12}{240}" /> |
| **2 Marbles** | <InlineMath math="\frac{4}{16} \times \frac{4}{15}" /> | <InlineMath math="\frac{16}{240}" /> |
| **1 Ball & 1 Barbie** | <InlineMath math="(\frac{5}{16} \times \frac{3}{15}) + (\frac{4}{16} \times \frac{4}{15})" /> | <InlineMath math="\frac{15+16}{240} = \frac{31}{240}" /> |
| **1 Barbie & 1 Marble** | <InlineMath math="(\frac{4}{16} \times \frac{4}{15}) + (\frac{4}{16} \times \frac{3}{15})" /> | <InlineMath math="\frac{16+12}{240} = \frac{28}{240}" /> |
| **1 Bear & 1 Ball** | <InlineMath math="(\frac{3}{16} \times \frac{4}{15}) + (\frac{5}{16} \times \frac{4}{15})" /> | <InlineMath math="\frac{12+20}{240} = \frac{32}{240}" /> |

> For combinations of two different types of toys (e.g., Ball and Barbie), there are two possibilities: Ball from Box 1 & Barbie from Box 2, OR Barbie from Box 1 & Ball from Box 2.

#### Conclusion

From the calculations above, we compare the numerators since the denominators are the same (<InlineMath math="240" />):

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="12 < 16 < 28 < 31 < 32" />
</MathContainer>

The largest probability is **<InlineMath math="\frac{32}{240}" />**, which corresponds to the combination of **1 teddy bear and 1 ball**.
