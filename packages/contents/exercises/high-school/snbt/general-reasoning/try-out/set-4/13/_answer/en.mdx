Let's analyze the sentence structure and vocabulary of the hypothetical language.

**Vocabulary Analysis:**

*   **bluwpz**: fish
*   **ckeeck?**: young bird

#### Sentence Structure Analysis

Example sentence: **bo ckeeck? mwbluwpz**

Meaning: "a fish watches a young bird"

If we break down the structure:

*   **bo**: Sentence starter (marker).
*   **ckeeck?**: Object (young bird). Notice that the object is placed after the word "bo".
*   **mwbluwpz**: Subject (fish) with the prefix **mw-**. The root word "bluwpz" (fish) gets the "mw-" prefix.

So, the sentence pattern for "Subject watches Object" is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{bo} + \text{Object} + \text{mw-}\text{Subject}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Application to the Question

We are asked to translate: "a young bird watches a fish".

*   **Subject**: young bird (**ckeeck?**) <InlineMath math="\rightarrow" /> must add the **mw-** prefix to become **mwckeeck?**.
*   **Object**: fish (**bluwpz**) <InlineMath math="\rightarrow" /> placed after "bo".

So the arrangement becomes:

1.  Starter word: **bo**
2.  Object: **bluwpz**
3.  Subject (with mw-): **mwckeeck?**

Combination: **bo bluwpz mwckeeck?**
