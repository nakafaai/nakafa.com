The Indonesian Food and Drug Supervisory Agency (BPOM) RI still finds unhealthy school children's snacks, whether due to microbial contamination, chemical contamination, misuse of hazardous ingredients, and also the use of food additives exceeding the maximum permitted limit. If they continue to consume unhealthy snacks, it will have a negative impact on children. The Chairman of the Indonesian Pediatric Society (IDAI), Dr.dr, Rini S, SpA(K), revealed that the child's growth and development process is influenced by nutrition and stimulation. Quality nutritional intake must meet the principles of balanced nutrition, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water.
