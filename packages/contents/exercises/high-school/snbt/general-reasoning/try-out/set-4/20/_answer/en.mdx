The main focus of the text is on the importance of nutrition for child development, where the IDAI Chairman emphasizes one key point:

> "**These nutrients can be fulfilled through main meals and snacks including street food.**"

Here is a concise analysis of why the other options are less accurate compared to the fact above:

| Option Statement | Logical Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| All snacks are unhealthy | **Generalization**. BPOM only "still finds" cases, implying not *all* snacks are problematic. |
| No snacks = no negative impact | **Logical Fallacy**. Text states <InlineMath math="p \rightarrow q" /> (bad snacks <InlineMath math="\rightarrow" /> impact). This option (<InlineMath math="\neg p \rightarrow \neg q" />) is logically invalid. |
| Nutrition *only* from snacks | **Exclusion**. The text clearly states main meals **and** snacks, not just one source. |
| Health impacts will *definitely* occur | **Too Absolute**. The text uses "can cause" and "needs further research", not absolute certainty. |

Thus, the most valid conclusion directly supported by the text is that **snacks including children's snacks can be used as a source of nutrition**.
