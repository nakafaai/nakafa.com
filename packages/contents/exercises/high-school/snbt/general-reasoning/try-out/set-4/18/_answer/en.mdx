We need to calculate the probability for each scenario given in the options.

Total books in each shelf:
- Shelf A = <InlineMath math="5 + 3 + 4 = 12" />.
- Shelf B = <InlineMath math="3 + 3 + 6 = 12" />.

The total possible pairs of books taken is <InlineMath math="12 \times 12 = 144" />.

#### Analysis of Each Option

We will calculate the probability (<InlineMath math="P" />) for each event.

1. 2 fiction books

   Taking 1 fiction from Shelf A and 1 fiction from Shelf B.

   <MathContainer>
     <BlockMath math="P(\text{2 Fiction}) = \frac{5}{12} \times \frac{3}{12} = \frac{15}{144}" />
   </MathContainer>

2. 1 fiction book and 1 science book

   There are two possibilities:
   - Fiction from Shelf A and Science from Shelf B: <InlineMath math="\frac{5}{12} \times \frac{3}{12} = \frac{15}{144}" />
   - Science from Shelf A and Fiction from Shelf B: <InlineMath math="\frac{3}{12} \times \frac{3}{12} = \frac{9}{144}" />

   <MathContainer>
     <BlockMath math="P(\text{1 Fiction, 1 Science}) = \frac{15}{144} + \frac{9}{144} = \frac{24}{144}" />
   </MathContainer>

3. 1 science book and 1 history book

   There are two possibilities:
   - Science from Shelf A and History from Shelf B: <InlineMath math="\frac{3}{12} \times \frac{6}{12} = \frac{18}{144}" />
   - History from Shelf A and Science from Shelf B: <InlineMath math="\frac{4}{12} \times \frac{3}{12} = \frac{12}{144}" />

   <MathContainer>
     <BlockMath math="P(\text{1 Science, 1 History}) = \frac{18}{144} + \frac{12}{144} = \frac{30}{144}" />
   </MathContainer>

4. 2 history books

   Taking 1 history from Shelf A and 1 history from Shelf B.

   <MathContainer>
     <BlockMath math="P(\text{2 History}) = \frac{4}{12} \times \frac{6}{12} = \frac{24}{144}" />
   </MathContainer>

5. 2 science books

   Taking 1 science from Shelf A and 1 science from Shelf B.

   <MathContainer>
     <BlockMath math="P(\text{2 Science}) = \frac{3}{12} \times \frac{3}{12} = \frac{9}{144}" />
   </MathContainer>

#### Conclusion

Let's compare the probability results (all denominators are 144):
- 2 fiction books: 15
- 1 fiction book and 1 science book: 24
- 1 science book and 1 history book: 30
- 2 history books: 24
- 2 science books: 9

The smallest value is 9.

Thus, the smallest probability is for the child to get **2 science books**.
