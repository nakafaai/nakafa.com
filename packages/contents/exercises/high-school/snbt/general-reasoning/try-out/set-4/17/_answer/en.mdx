We will first find the speed of engine A, then calculate the speed of engine B, and finally determine the distance traveled by engine B.

Given:
-   Speed of engine A: <InlineMath math="v_A" />
-   Speed of engine B: <InlineMath math="v_B = \frac{1}{3} v_A" />
-   Distance traveled by engine A (<InlineMath math="s_A" />) = <InlineMath math="20\text{ km}" />
-   Time taken by engine A (<InlineMath math="t_A" />) = <InlineMath math="2\text{ hours}" />
-   Time taken by engine B (<InlineMath math="t_B" />) = <InlineMath math="3\text{ hours}" />

#### Calculating Speed of Engine A

Speed is defined as distance divided by time (<InlineMath math="v = \frac{s}{t}" />).

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="v_A = \frac{s_A}{t_A} = \frac{20\text{ km}}{2\text{ hours}} = 10\text{ km/hour}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating Speed of Engine B

Since <InlineMath math="v_B = \frac{1}{3} v_A" />, then:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="v_B = \frac{1}{3} \times 10\text{ km/hour} = \frac{10}{3}\text{ km/hour}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating Distance Traveled by Engine B

Distance traveled is speed multiplied by time (<InlineMath math="s = v \times t" />).

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="s_B = v_B \times t_B = \frac{10}{3} \times 3 = 10\text{ km}" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the distance traveled using engine B is **<InlineMath math="10\text{ km}" />**.
