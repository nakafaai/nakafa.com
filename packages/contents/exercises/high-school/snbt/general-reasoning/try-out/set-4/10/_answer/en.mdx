Let's translate the statements into mathematical logic.

Let:

*   <InlineMath math="p" />: Nakafa students work on conditional empathy questions.
*   <InlineMath math="q" />: Nakafa students can work on TOBK questions on the Nakafa app.
*   <InlineMath math="r" />: Nakafa students get Learning Achievement Evaluation (EPB) results.

The given statements are:

1.  If Nakafa students work on conditional empathy questions, then they can work on TOBK questions on the Nakafa app (<InlineMath math="p \rightarrow q" />).
2.  If Nakafa students work on TOBK questions on the Nakafa app, then they get Learning Achievement Evaluation (EPB) results (<InlineMath math="q \rightarrow r" />).
3.  Fact: Dito works on TOBK questions on the Nakafa app (<InlineMath math="q" />).

We have the premise <InlineMath math="q \rightarrow r" /> and the fact <InlineMath math="q" />. Based on the **Modus Ponens** rule of inference:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{align*} & q \rightarrow r \\ & q \\ \hline \therefore \ & r \end{align*}" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the conclusion is <InlineMath math="r" />, which is Dito gets Learning Achievement Evaluation (EPB) results.

Note that the first premise (<InlineMath math="p \rightarrow q" />) is not directly used to draw this conclusion because the fact we have is <InlineMath math="q" />, not <InlineMath math="p" />. Even though <InlineMath math="q" /> occurs, we cannot conclude <InlineMath math="p" /> (affirming the consequent is a fallacy). The main focus is the implication from <InlineMath math="q" /> to <InlineMath math="r" />.
