Let's analyze each option based on the data in the table. The data provided is per <InlineMath math="100" /> grams, so the gram value is equal to the percentage (<InlineMath math="x" /> grams in <InlineMath math="100" /> grams is equal to <InlineMath math="x\%" />).

#### Option Analysis

1.  **Statement: Tempeh has higher energy content compared to beef.**

    -   Tempeh Energy: <InlineMath math="201" /> kcal.
    -   Beef Energy: <InlineMath math="273" /> kcal.
    -   Since <InlineMath math="201 < 273" />, this statement is **false**.

2.  **Statement: Tempeh has little nutritional content compared to beef.**

    This statement is subjective and not fully supported by the data. Tempeh has advantages in protein, carbohydrates, and fiber. This statement is **incorrect**.

3.  **Statement: Beef has many nutritional advantages compared to tempeh.**

    Similar to before, beef only excels in energy and fat, while tempeh excels in protein, carbohydrates, and fiber. This statement is **incorrect**.

4.  **Statement: Protein content in tempeh is <InlineMath math="3.3\%" /> greater than protein content in beef.**

    -   Tempeh Protein: <InlineMath math="20.8" /> gr (<InlineMath math="20.8\%" />).
    -   Beef Protein: <InlineMath math="17.5" /> gr (<InlineMath math="17.5\%" />).
    -   Difference:

        <MathContainer>
          <BlockMath math="20.8 - 17.5 = 3.3 \text{ gr}" />
        </MathContainer>

    -   Since the basis is <InlineMath math="100" /> grams, a difference of <InlineMath math="3.3" /> grams is equivalent to a percentage difference of <InlineMath math="3.3\%" />. This statement is **true**.

5.  **Statement: Fat content in beef is <InlineMath math="12.2\%" /> greater than fat content in tempeh.**

    -   Beef Fat: <InlineMath math="22" /> gr.
    -   Tempeh Fat: <InlineMath math="8.8" /> gr.
    -   Difference:

        <MathContainer>
          <BlockMath math="22 - 8.8 = 13.2 \text{ gr}" />
        </MathContainer>

    -   The difference is <InlineMath math="13.2" /> grams (or <InlineMath math="13.2\%" />), not <InlineMath math="12.2\%" />. This statement is **false**.

Therefore, the most appropriate conclusion is that the protein content in tempeh is <InlineMath math="3.3\%" /> greater than the protein content in beef.
