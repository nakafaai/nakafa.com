Let's analyze each option based on the data in the chart.

#### Answer Choice Analysis

1.  **Product Noodle A never experienced a price decrease**
    -   2017 to 2018: <InlineMath math="3500 \to 2500" /> (Decrease)
    -   2019 to 2020: <InlineMath math="3350 \to 3000" /> (Decrease)
    -   This statement is **false** because Noodle A experienced price decreases twice.

2.  **The price increase of Noodle B in 2019—2020 was higher than the price increase of Noodle B from 2017—2019**
    -   Increase 2019—2020: <InlineMath math="4500 - 4000 = 500" />
    -   Change 2017—2019: <InlineMath math="4000 - 4500 = -500" /> (Decrease)
    -   Comparing an increase with a decrease implies both increased, which is not true. Since 2017—2019 saw a decrease, this statement is **incorrect**.

3.  **There is a Noodle product that experienced only one price decrease**
    -   **Noodle C** experienced price increases in 2017—2018 (<InlineMath math="2250 \to 2500" />) and 2018—2019 (<InlineMath math="2500 \to 2800" />).
    -   However, in 2019—2020, the price decreased (<InlineMath math="2800 \to 2650" />).
    -   Thus, Noodle C experienced only **one price decrease**, making this statement **true**.

4.  **Almost all Instant Noodle products frequently experience price increases**
    -   There are 9 price transitions in total (3 products <InlineMath math="\times" /> 3 periods).
    -   Increases occurred 4 times: Noodle A (1x), Noodle B (1x), Noodle C (2x).
    -   Decreases occurred 5 times: Noodle A (2x), Noodle B (2x), Noodle C (1x).
    -   The frequency of decreases is higher than increases, so this statement is **false**.

5.  **The price of Noodle A did not experience a drastic decrease**
    -   From 2017—2018, the price of Noodle A dropped from <InlineMath math="3500" /> to <InlineMath math="2500" /> (a drop of <InlineMath math="1000" /> or approximately <InlineMath math="28.6\%" />).
    -   This decrease is quite significant, so this statement is likely **false**.

#### Conclusion

The correct conclusion based on the data is that **there is a Noodle product that experienced only one price decrease**, which is **Noodle C**.
