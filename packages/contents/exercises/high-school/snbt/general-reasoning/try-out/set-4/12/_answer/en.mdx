To determine the correct statement, let's analyze each option based on the text:

1.  **Free radicals grow cancer cells**: The text mentions that free radicals "cause the growth of cancer cells", not that they actively "grow" cancer cells. The focus of the text is on the benefits of Matoa fruit in warding off these free radicals.

2.  **Scientific definition of Matoa fruit**: The text provides a general description of the Matoa fruit (origin, physical characteristics, fruiting season, taste, and benefits), not just a scientific definition.

3.  **Matoa trees do not bear fruit every year**: The text states that the Matoa tree bears fruit "from July to October **each year**". So, this statement is false.

4.  **Matoa fruit has many benefits**: The text mentions various benefits of Matoa fruit, including:
    -   Contains high nutrients and antioxidants.
    -   Able to ward off free radicals.
    -   Acts as an energy booster.
    -   Increases body resistance.

    Therefore, this statement is true as it summarizes the benefits mentioned.

5.  **Matoa fruit does not resemble any fruit**: The text explicitly states that its texture and color are "like rambutan, longan, or lychee" and its taste is also "almost similar". So, this statement is false.

In conclusion, the most appropriate statement supported by the text is that the Matoa fruit has many benefits.
