Based on the paragraph, until the end of April 2019, procurement realization was only <InlineMath math="321,123" /> tons or <InlineMath math="1.78" /> percent of this year's target. We can calculate the procurement target (<InlineMath math="x" />) as follows:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{align*} \text{Realization} &= 1.78\% \times \text{Target} \\ 321,123 &= \frac{1.78}{100} \times x \\ x &= \frac{100}{1.78} \times 321,123 \\ x &\approx 18,040,618 \text{ tons} \end{align*}" />
</MathContainer>

The calculated result is approximately <InlineMath math="18" /> million tons.

Therefore, the rice procurement target for 2019 is **18 million tons**.
