Domestic absorption, which has tended to decline in the last three years, could impact increasingly large rice imports. Meanwhile, the balance of rice procurement by Perum Bulog is considered worrying and potentially weakens the price stability function. One of the solutions that can be implemented is that Bulog must be given priority in rice distribution in the BPNT (non-cash food assistance) program so that it does not potentially lose out from a business perspective. Without resolving the distribution channel problem, the rice problem will be locked/stagnant and the solution to enlarge the distribution channel can be taken (by the government) by prioritizing rice from Perum Bulog in the BPNT program. That solution, according to Sapuan Gafar – former Deputy Head of Bulog and Secretary to the State Minister for Food Affairs 1993—1999 – is relatively easy and does not change budget allocations and does not change its nomenclature. However, that solution can be done by revising Presidential Regulation Number 63 of 2017 concerning Non-Cash Social Assistance Distribution.
