Given:
1.  Bananas contain **a lot of vitamin B6** and **little fat**.
2.  A child consumes bananas.

Thus, the child will get a lot of vitamin B6 and **little fat**.

We are asked to find the **incorrect** statement.

-   The statement "The child will not get any fat" is **incorrect**. Because even though bananas contain *little* fat, they still contain some fat. "Little" is not the same as "none at all" (zero).

Therefore, the incorrect possibility is that the child will not get any fat.
