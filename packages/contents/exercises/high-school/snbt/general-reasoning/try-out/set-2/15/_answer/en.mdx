Based on the chart:

The Government Purchase Price for GKP (Dry Harvested Grain) from January to April remained constant at Rp<InlineMath math="3,700.00" />/kg.

The line on the chart for "Government Purchase Price" appears flat (horizontal) from January to April, indicating no increase or decrease in price. A condition where a value does not change over a certain period is called **stagnant**.

Therefore, the most correct statement is **the government purchase price for grain, specifically GKP, is stagnant or does not change from January—April**.
