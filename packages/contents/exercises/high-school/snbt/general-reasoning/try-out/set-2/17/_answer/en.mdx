Analysis of book distribution based on student preferences and availability (only 1 copy for each type):

1. **Reni**: Likes only religious books. Since there are no other options for Reni, **Reni must get the religious book**.

2. **Tita**: Likes dictionaries and religious books.
   - Since the religious book has already been taken by Reni, the only remaining option for Tita is the dictionary.
   - Thus, **Tita gets the dictionary**.

Analysis for other students (additional context):

- **Qila**: Likes religious books and literature. Religion (Reni) is taken. So Qila gets **literature**.

- **Putri**: Likes science, literature, and history. Literature (Qila) is taken. Science and history remain.

- **Sinta**: Likes science, dictionaries, religious books, and literature. Dictionary (Tita), Religion (Reni), and Literature (Qila) are taken. Sinta must get **science**.

- Therefore, **Putri** gets **history**.

In conclusion, the book that must be given to Tita is the **dictionary**.
