A child takes fruits from two different boxes. The composition of fruits in each box is as follows:

| Box 1 | Box 2 | Fruit Type |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| <InlineMath math="1" /> | <InlineMath math="4" /> | Large apple |
| <InlineMath math="2" /> | <InlineMath math="2" /> | Small apple |
| <InlineMath math="4" /> | <InlineMath math="3" /> | Large orange |
| <InlineMath math="5" /> | <InlineMath math="3" /> | Small orange |

If a child takes one fruit from Box 1 and one fruit from Box 2, which combination is the most likely result?
