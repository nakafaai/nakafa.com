The realization of domestic rice procurement by Perum Bulog continues to decline from <InlineMath math="2.96" /> million tons in 2016 to <InlineMath math="2.16" /> million tons in 2017, and <InlineMath math="1.44" /> million tons last year. Apart from the Government Purchase Price (HPP) increasingly lagging behind market prices, the sluggish procurement is also considered to be contributed by the reduction in rice distribution channels following the change in the food assistance distribution mechanism for Raskin/Rastra to direct transfers. As a result, until the end of April 2019, procurement realization was only <InlineMath math="321,123" /> tons or <InlineMath math="1.78" /> percent of this year's target. In fact, the *rendeng* season harvest is relied upon as the main source of rice procurement this year. If procurement is not optimal, the Government Rice Reserve (CBP) threatens to be insufficient, especially during the upcoming lean season. This means that government rice stocks threaten to be insufficient if rice procurement continues to decline.

Based on the passage, what is the rice procurement target for 2019?
