Statistics Indonesia (BPS) data records the national export value of ready-made clothing throughout 2018:

-   Destination country US = US$ <InlineMath math="3.78" /> billion.
-   Destination country Japan = US$ <InlineMath math="740.9" /> million (approx. US$ <InlineMath math="0.74" /> billion).
-   Destination country Germany = US$ <InlineMath math="372.48" /> million (approx. US$ <InlineMath math="0.37" /> billion).

The text states that Japan is the **second** largest export destination. Since the export value to the United States (US$ <InlineMath math="3.78" /> billion) is much larger than to Japan, and no other country is mentioned as having a higher value, it can be concluded that the United States is the main market (the first largest).

Therefore, the most likely correct conclusion is **The main market for Indonesia's ready-made clothing products is the United States**.
