A password consists of <InlineMath math="4" /> characters consisting of digits and vowels with the following order:

| DIGIT | LETTER | DIGIT | LETTER |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

The rules for arrangement are:
1. The first digit is an even number.
2. The second digit is chosen from the set <InlineMath math="\{5, 6, 7\}" />.
3. The first letter is not E.
4. The second letter is U.

Determine how many password arrangements can be formed from these rules?
