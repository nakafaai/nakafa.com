Based on the first sentence of the paragraph: "Domestic absorption, which has tended to decline in the last three years, could impact increasingly large rice imports."

This statement shows the relationship between "domestic absorption" and "rice imports".
- If absorption **declines** (goes down), then imports become **large** (go up).
- A relationship where one variable increases while the other decreases is called an **inversely proportional** relationship.

Therefore, the most correct statement is **the impact of domestic absorption on rice imports is inversely proportional**.
