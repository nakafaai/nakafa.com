Based on the paragraph, it is stated that: "If procurement is not optimal, the Government Rice Reserve (CBP) threatens to be insufficient, especially during the upcoming lean season. This means that government rice stocks threaten to be insufficient if rice procurement continues to decline."

From this statement, it can be concluded that if rice procurement is not optimal or continues to decline, then government rice stocks or CBP will be threatened to decrease.

Therefore, the most correct conclusion is **government rice stocks or CBP (government rice reserves) will be threatened to decrease**.
