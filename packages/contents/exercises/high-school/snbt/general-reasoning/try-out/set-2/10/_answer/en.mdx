First, let's calculate the total number of fruits in each box:
- **Box 1**: <InlineMath math="1 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 12" /> fruits.
- **Box 2**: <InlineMath math="4 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 12" /> fruits.
- **Total Possibilities**: <InlineMath math="12 \times 12 = 144" /> combinations.

We will calculate the probability for each option. Recall that the probability of independent events occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities.

| Event | Calculation | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2 Large Apples** | <InlineMath math="\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{4}{12}" /> | <InlineMath math="\frac{4}{144}" /> |
| **2 Small Apples** | <InlineMath math="\frac{2}{12} \times \frac{2}{12}" /> | <InlineMath math="\frac{4}{144}" /> |
| **2 Large Oranges** | <InlineMath math="\frac{4}{12} \times \frac{3}{12}" /> | <InlineMath math="\frac{12}{144}" /> |
| **2 Small Oranges** | <InlineMath math="\frac{5}{12} \times \frac{3}{12}" /> | <InlineMath math="\frac{15}{144}" /> |
| **1 Large Apple & 1 Small Orange** | <InlineMath math="(\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{3}{12}) + (\frac{5}{12} \times \frac{4}{12})" /> | <InlineMath math="\frac{23}{144}" /> |

> For the event **1 Large Apple & 1 Small Orange**, there are two possible ways to obtain it:
>
> 1. Large Apple from Box 1 and Small Orange from Box 2 (<InlineMath math="\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{3}{12}" />).
> 2. Small Orange from Box 1 and Large Apple from Box 2 (<InlineMath math="\frac{5}{12} \times \frac{4}{12}" />).
>
> These two probabilities are added together.

From the table above, we can see that the highest probability is obtaining **1 large apple and 1 small orange** with a probability of <InlineMath math="\frac{23}{144}" />.

Thus, the most likely result is **1 large apple and 1 small orange**.
