From the given information, we know the following vocabulary:
- **o!miaw** = cat
- **mee!ow** = girl

The example sentence **"o!miaw nmee!owi eng"** means **"a girl is watching a cat"**. Breaking down its structure:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\underbrace{\text{o!miaw}}_{\text{Object (Cat)}} \quad \underbrace{\text{n...i eng}}_{\text{Predicate (watching)}} \quad \text{Subject (Girl)}" />
</MathContainer>

This sentence pattern has specific rules:
1. The **Object** is placed at the **beginning** of the sentence.
2. The verb "watching" follows the pattern **n ... i eng**, where the **Subject** is inserted in the middle.
3. The 'w' at the end of the subject merges with 'i' to form 'wi' (mee!ow <InlineMath math="\rightarrow" /> nmee!owi).

To translate **"a cat is watching a girl"**, we swap the subject and object:
- Subject: **Cat** (**o!miaw**)
- Object: **Girl** (**mee!ow**)

The arrangement becomes:
1. **Object** at the front: **mee!ow**
2. **Predicate + Subject**: Insert **o!miaw** into the pattern **n ... i eng** to become **no!miawi eng**.

Thus, the complete sentence is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\underbrace{\text{mee!ow}}_{\text{Object}} \quad \underbrace{\text{no!miawi eng}}_{\text{Predicate + Subject}}" />
</MathContainer>

So, the answer is **mee!ow no!miawi eng**.
