Drawing a conclusion using Syllogism.

Let:
- <InlineMath math="p" /> = Activity has been carried out.
- <InlineMath math="q" /> = Activity report is submitted.
- <InlineMath math="r" /> = Employee honorarium is paid.

Premise 1: If the activity has been carried out, then the activity report is submitted (<InlineMath math="p \rightarrow q" />).

Premise 2: If the activity report is submitted, then the employee honorarium is paid (<InlineMath math="q \rightarrow r" />).

The conclusion from these two premises is <InlineMath math="p \rightarrow r" />. The statement <InlineMath math="p \rightarrow r" /> is equivalent to its contrapositive, which is <InlineMath math="\sim r \rightarrow \sim p" />.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{aligned}
  \text{Premise 1} &: p \rightarrow q \\
  \text{Premise 2} &: q \rightarrow r \\
  \hline
  \text{Conclusion} &: p \rightarrow r \equiv \sim r \rightarrow \sim p
  \end{aligned}" />
</MathContainer>

Meaning: "If the employee honorarium is not paid, it means the activity has not been carried out."

Therefore, the most appropriate conclusion is **if the employee's honorarium is not paid, it means the activity has not been carried out**.
