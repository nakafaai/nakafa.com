Drawing a conclusion using Disjunctive Syllogism.

Let:
- <InlineMath math="p" /> = Community service to clean gutters is carried out.
- <InlineMath math="q" /> = Community service to collect used goods is carried out.

Premise 1: On Sunday, community service will be held to clean the gutters or collect used goods (<InlineMath math="p \lor q" />).

Premise 2: On Sunday, it rained, so the community service to clean the gutters could not be carried out (<InlineMath math="\sim p" />).

The conclusion from these two premises is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{aligned}
  \text{Premise 1} &: p \lor q \\
  \text{Premise 2} &: \sim p \\
  \hline
  \text{Conclusion} &: q
  \end{aligned}" />
</MathContainer>

Meaning: **On Sunday, community service to collect used goods was carried out.**
