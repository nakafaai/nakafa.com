The statement to be weakened is **"New students will choose private universities with low costs"**.

To weaken this statement, we need to find a fact or argument showing that low cost is not the only reason, or that students are willing to pay a high price.

The option stating that **new students will still choose a good private university even if it is expensive** directly contradicts the conclusion that they only choose cheap ones. This shows that quality (lecturers and facilities) can outweigh the low-cost factor in their decision.

Thus, this argument weakens the statement that new students will only choose private universities with low costs.
