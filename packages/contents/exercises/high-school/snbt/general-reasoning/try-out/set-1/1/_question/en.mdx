PIMN (National Mango Innovation Week) commemorated on November 15, 2019, and attended by Minister of Agriculture Syahrul Yasin Limpo, became a momentum for mango farmers and producers in Pasuruan, East Java, to display/showcase their harvests consisting of various types of mangoes from East Java, West Java, superior varieties, and abroad. Various types of mangoes with different shapes, colors, and sizes attracted the interest of visitors to take pictures, even taking selfies with the tropical fruit. The description of the mango names provided knowledge or reminded us that there are hundreds of mango types in the world. Apparently, mangoes are not just the fragrant sweet (*arum manis*), manalagi, gedong gincu, and avocado (gedong 21) types that have been widely sold in supermarkets, traditional markets, or street vendors.
