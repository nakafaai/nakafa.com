We can solve this problem by calculating the total volume of water and dividing it by the combined flow rate of the three taps.

#### Calculating the Water Tank Volume

The water tank is cubic with a side length of <InlineMath math="4 \text{ dm}" />. The volume of the tank is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="V = s \times s \times s = 4 \times 4 \times 4 = 64 \text{ dm}^3" />
</MathContainer>

Recall that <InlineMath math="1 \text{ dm}^3 = 1 \text{ liter}" />, so the volume of water in the tank is <InlineMath math="64" /> liters.

#### Calculating the Combined Flow Rate

Since all three taps are opened simultaneously, we sum the flow rates of each tap:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{aligned} Q_{total} &= Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 \\ Q_{total} &= 4 + 3 + 1 \\ Q_{total} &= 8 \text{ liters/minute} \end{aligned}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating the Time

The time required (<InlineMath math="t" />) for the water to run out is the volume divided by the total flow rate:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="t = \frac{V}{Q_{total}} = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \text{ minutes}" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the water in the tank will run out in **8 minutes**.
