To answer this question, we need to understand the cause-and-effect relationship explained in the text. The text states that the success in increasing agricultural production has a consequence, namely that the import of food commodities can be suppressed. This means the condition of "imports being suppressed" occurs when "production increases/is spurred".

Furthermore, the text explains that the opportunity to spur food production is still wide open. One specifically mentioned way is **narrowing the productivity gap between farmers in Java and outside Java**.

Therefore, if we talk about the condition where imports can be suppressed (which is the result of increased production), then it is closely related to the efforts to spur production itself, one of which is done by narrowing the farmer gap. The answer choice stating **"Food production is spurred, one of the ways is by narrowing the gap between farmers in Java and outside Java"** is the most relevant statement supported by the text as the context of the success in suppressing imports.

Other options are not supported by the text:
1.  **Appropriate programs are needed...**: The text mentions that government programs have already been successful, not just "needed".
2.  **In accordance with regional elements**: Not specifically mentioned.
3.  **Farmers freely... without danger of imports**: This is an excessive assumption and not in the text.
4.  **Producing agricultural land**: This phrase is ambiguous (land is not produced by farmers) and does not fit the context.
