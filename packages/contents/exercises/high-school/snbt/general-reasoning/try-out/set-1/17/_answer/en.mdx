The text explains the close relationship between nutritional adequacy and a child's physical growth.

#### Text Logic Analysis
1.  **Premise 1**: Nutritional adequacy indicators are assessed primarily from growth.
2.  **Premise 2**: Growth is assessed from weight gain and height gain.
3.  **Conclusion**: Thus, nutritional status (and growth-related health) can be monitored through weight and height.

#### Options Analysis
1.  **First option**: Uses the phrase "part of health" and only mentions "body weight," whereas the text emphasizes both weight and height together as main indicators.
2.  **Second option**: The phrasing is slightly inverted. Weight and height are *parameters* to assess nutrition, not the other way around.
3.  **Third option**: Only mentions "part of nutrition" and "can play a role," which is too weak compared to the text's emphasis on "assessed primarily."
4.  **Fourth option**: Concludes comprehensively that health indicators (in the context of nutrition/growth) can be seen from nutritional adequacy manifested through weight and height. This summarizes the text's logical flow from Nutrition -> Growth -> Weight & Height.
5.  **Fifth option**: States that indicators function to "control," whereas the text states indicators function to "assess" or monitor, not as a direct control tool.

Therefore, the conclusion that is most appropriate and covers the entire premise is the fourth option.
