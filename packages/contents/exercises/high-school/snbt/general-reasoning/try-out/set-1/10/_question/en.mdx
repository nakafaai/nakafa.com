A cubic water tank has dimensions of <InlineMath math="4 \text{ dm} \times 4 \text{ dm} \times 4 \text{ dm}" />. At the bottom front, there are three water taps with different flow rates as follows:

1. Flow rate of tap <InlineMath math="1 = 4" /> liters/minute.
2. Flow rate of tap <InlineMath math="2 = 3" /> liters/minute.
3. Flow rate of tap <InlineMath math="3 = 1" /> liter/minute.

If all three taps are opened simultaneously, the water in the tank (assuming it is full) will run out in...
