To find the difference in the average increase of rice production, we need to look at the statistical data mentioned in the second paragraph of the text:

1.  The average increase in rice production throughout <InlineMath math="2014 - 2018" /> was <InlineMath math="3.0" /> percent.
2.  The average increase in rice production throughout <InlineMath math="2010 - 2014" /> was <InlineMath math="1.39" /> percent.

The difference in increase can be calculated by subtracting the smaller percentage value from the larger one:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Difference} = 3.0\% - 1.39\% = 1.61\%" />
</MathContainer>

So, the difference in the average increase of rice production between the two periods is <InlineMath math="1.61\%" />.
