To find the most true statement, we need to analyze each answer choice based on the information in the text.

The statement that **crossbreeding methods and selection methods are used by researchers in exploring mango germplasm collections** is the most accurate statement. The text mentions that through the exploration of the germplasm collection, researchers use two paths (methods), namely the selection method and the crossbreeding method. Both methods are part of the researchers' efforts in utilizing and developing the collection. Although the question mark at the end of the sentence in the answer choice might be confusing, content-wise this statement aligns with the fact that researchers use both methods in the context of their research.

The statement regarding type <InlineMath math="65" /> F1 being obtained by **local farmers** is incorrect. The text explicitly states that **researchers** (not local farmers) performed the crossbreeding and obtained that type.

The statement that denarum agrihorti mango is a **result of selection** is incorrect. The text mentions that denarum agrihorti is one of the two variants **resulting from crossbreeding**.

The statement regarding the characteristics of agri gardina-45 mango is also incorrect. The description "medium fruit flesh, low fiber quantity, sweet slightly sour taste, and high vitamin C content" in the text is attached to the **denarum agrihorti** mango (mentioned after this variety name and the dash), not agri gardina-45.

The statement that Indonesia has become a **world reference** is not mentioned at all in the text. The text only discusses the collection in the state-owned garden, Ministry of Agriculture research, and export consumer preferences (Japan).

Therefore, the most true statement is the one regarding the use of crossbreeding and selection methods by researchers.
