The question asks for an argument that **strengthens** the idea that instant noodles can be consumed well based on the text.

#### Text Analysis
The text provides two main points for consuming instant noodles safely or more healthily:
1.  **Must not be excessive** (first sentence).
2.  **Processing tips**, which include: replace boiling water, **sauté with olive oil**, don't use the included seasoning, add protein, and add vegetables.

#### Options Analysis
1.  **First option**: Mentions "increasing body resistance," which is not in the text.
2.  **Second option**: Combines the main condition "not in excess" and one of the specific tips "sautéed with olive oil." This is directly supported by the text.
3.  **Third option**: Mentions "boosting the immune system," which is not mentioned as a direct effect in the text.
4.  **Fourth option**: True that protein is needed, but the second option is more comprehensive as it covers the quantity aspect (not excessive) emphasized at the beginning of the text.
5.  **Fifth option**: Concluding that instant noodles are "very good" as an alternative food is an over-claim not supported by the text.

Therefore, the argument most consistent with and supported by the text is consumption that is not excessive and uses processing tips such as sautéing with olive oil.
