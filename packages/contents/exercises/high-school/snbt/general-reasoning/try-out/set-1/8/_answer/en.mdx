To calculate the expenditure on agricultural production facilities and infrastructure, we need to use the percentage information found in the text.

Given:
1.  Total expenditure on agricultural production facilities and infrastructure reached the range of <InlineMath math="70" /> percent of the total Ministry of Agriculture budget.
2.  The total Ministry of Agriculture budget in <InlineMath math="2018" /> was <InlineMath math="Rp100,000,000,000.00" />.

Calculation:
<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Expenditure Amount} = \frac{70}{100} \times 100,000,000,000" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Expenditure Amount} = 70,000,000,000" />
</MathContainer>

So, the amount of expenditure on agricultural production facilities and infrastructure is <InlineMath math="Rp70,000,000,000.00" />.
