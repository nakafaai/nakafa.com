The Ministry of Agriculture (Kemtan) has successfully increased agricultural production, especially food crop commodities, significantly in the last four years. Consequently, imports of a number of food commodities can be suppressed. Opportunities to spur food production are actually still wide open without the need to increase agricultural land area. One way is to narrow the productivity gap between farmers in Java and outside Java. Impressive performance in spurring food crop production is recorded by statistical data.

Throughout <InlineMath math="2014 - 2018" />, rice production was recorded to have increased by an average of <InlineMath math="3.0" /> percent per year. This rate of increase is higher than the average growth throughout <InlineMath math="2010 - 2014" /> which was only <InlineMath math="1.39" /> percent per year. Similar things – even more fantastic – also happened to corn commodities whose production on average grew by <InlineMath math="10.53" /> percent per year in the same period, higher than the <InlineMath math="2009 - 2014" /> period which was only <InlineMath math="1.66" /> percent. This certainly cannot be separated from the success of various government programs focused on efforts to increase production by spurring productivity (intensification) and land area (extensification). In this case, the government's serious efforts and strong commitment are reflected in the total expenditure on agricultural production facilities and infrastructure which reached the range of <InlineMath math="70" /> percent of the total Ministry of Agriculture budget (Kemtan <InlineMath math="2018" />).

Based on the text, if the government program is focused on efforts to increase production with intensification and extensification, what happens is ...
