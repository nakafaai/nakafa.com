Based on Indonesia's national emission reduction target (NDC/Nationally Determined Contributions), the largest contributors to carbon emissions are the forestry sector (<InlineMath math="47.8" /> percent) and the energy sector (<InlineMath math="34.5" /> percent). In a meeting with the Deputy Minister of Environment and Forestry, Alue Dohong, on Friday (<InlineMath math="6/12/2019" />), the President-designate of UN FCCC COP 26, Claire O’Neil Perry, said that the UK offered technical and financial assistance to Indonesia to transition energy from coal use to new and renewable energy. Meanwhile, separately, Greenpeace Indonesia Climate and Energy Campaigner, Tata Mustasya, on Sunday (<InlineMath math="8/12/2019" />), said that the direction of energy sector development in Indonesia contradicts the emission reduction target. In fact, Indonesia will build <InlineMath math="27" /> GW of new Coal Power Plants (PLTU) in addition to the existing <InlineMath math="28" /> GW Coal Power Plants. This will generate an additional <InlineMath math="200" /> million tons of carbon emissions per year.
