An analog clock (12-hour format) will show the same time as a normal clock again when the time difference reaches a multiple of 12 hours.

#### Converting Units to Minutes

Since the delay is given in minutes, we convert 12 hours into minutes:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="12 \text{ hours} = 12 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 720 \text{ minutes}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating the Required Time

It is known that the clock loses <InlineMath math="5" /> minutes every hour. We want to find how many hours (<InlineMath math="n" />) it takes for the total delay to reach <InlineMath math="720" /> minutes.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{aligned} 5n &= 720 \\ n &= \frac{720}{5} \\ n &= 144 \text{ hours} \end{aligned}" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the clock will show the same time as a normal clock after **144 hours**.
