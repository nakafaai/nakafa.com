In this state-owned garden, there is actually only one Indonesian mango germplasm collection, and through the exploration of that collection, it produced around <InlineMath math="370" /> accessions and <InlineMath math="100" /> types of crossbred mangoes. Researchers use two paths, namely the selection method to determine the variety allocation, for example, varieties suitable for fresh fruit or for juice, candied fruit, and so on. Another method is crossbreeding by combining superior traits of different mango types, then obtaining <InlineMath math="65" /> F1 types or variants. These results are processed again into <InlineMath math="100" /> descendants which become part of the collection because they have different traits even though they come from one parent. So far, the Ministry of Agriculture has released <InlineMath math="18" /> types of mango variants from research results at the research and development agency which include two variants from crossbreeding and <InlineMath math="16" /> variants from selection. The two crossbred variants are agri gardina-45 (called banana mango) – a cross between harum manis mango and saigon mango – and denarum agrihorti – a cross between arummanis-143 mango and haden mango from California, USA – with medium fruit flesh, low fiber quantity, fragrant aroma, and a sweet slightly sour taste with high vitamin C content (<InlineMath math="17.45 - 39.58" /> mg per <InlineMath math="100" /> gr). Meanwhile, efforts to make harum manis mangoes have red skin are important considering consumers in export destination countries are picky. For example, consumers in Japan like mangoes with red skin because they consider green-skinned mangoes to be unripe.
