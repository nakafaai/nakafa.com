To answer this question, we need to pay attention to the last sentence in the second paragraph which has a causal relationship with the previous sentence.

The text states: *"This certainly cannot be separated from the success of various government programs focused on efforts to increase production by spurring productivity (intensification) and land area (extensification). In this case, the government's serious efforts and strong commitment are reflected in the total expenditure on agricultural production facilities and infrastructure which reached the range of <InlineMath math="70" /> percent of the total Ministry of Agriculture budget (Kemtan <InlineMath math="2018" />)."*

The phrase "In this case" refers to the context of efforts to increase production through intensification and extensification mentioned earlier. Thus, the implication or reflection of the program's focus is the existence of serious efforts and government commitment seen from the budget allocation of <InlineMath math="70" /> percent.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice is **"there are serious efforts and strong commitment from the government reflected in the total expenditure on agricultural production facilities and infrastructure reaching <InlineMath math="70" /> percent of the total Ministry of Agriculture budget."**

Other options are incorrect because:
1.  **There must be a comprehensive effort... exceed 70 percent**: The text does not state a necessity to exceed <InlineMath math="70" /> percent, but rather the fact that the budget reached the range of <InlineMath math="70" /> percent.
2.  **Laws restricting imports...**: There is no mention of laws restricting imports as a direct result of the intensification/extensification focus in this text.
3.  **The best program is needed... so that exports are achieved**: The focus of the text is on increasing production and suppressing imports, not achieving export targets.
4.  **Cooperation between farmers and the government... clear laws**: There is no discussion about legal basis or vocation in this context.
