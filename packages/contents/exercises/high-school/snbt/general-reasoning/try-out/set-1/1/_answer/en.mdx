To determine the least true statement, we need to compare each option with the information provided in the text.

The statement that the Cukurgondang Kemtan Agricultural Technology Research and Development Installation Garden was established in <InlineMath math="1941" /> and has an area of thirteen hectares is true. This is stated in the last sentence of the text.

The statement regarding visitors being interested in taking pictures of mangoes of various shapes, colors, and sizes is also true. The second sentence explains that various types of mangoes attracted visitors to take pictures, even selfies.

The statement about the various kinds of mangoes exhibited containing names that broadened insight is also consistent with the text. It is mentioned that the description of mango names provided knowledge that there are hundreds of mango types in the world.

The statement that the garden initially only had <InlineMath math="208" /> mango varieties with <InlineMath math="289" /> accessions is also true, according to the last sentence.

However, the statement that in Pasuruan there are **people's plantations** cultivating various types of mangoes from domestic and foreign origins is **not fully supported by the text**. The text only mentions that PIMN became a momentum for farmers and producers in Pasuruan to **display or showcase** their harvests consisting of various types of mangoes from East Java, West Java, superior varieties, and abroad. The text does not explicitly state that Pasuruan farmers (people's plantations) cultivate those foreign mangoes; they might just be displaying them as part of the exhibition or collection from KIPPTP. Therefore, this statement is the least true compared to the others which have strong textual bases.
