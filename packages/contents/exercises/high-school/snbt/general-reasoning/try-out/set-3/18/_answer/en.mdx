We can analyze the given statements to draw a valid conclusion.

#### Premise Analysis

It is stated that **some people consume tea**, and **sometimes** the tea consumed is added with sugar. The word "sometimes" indicates that adding sugar does not always happen.

This means there are instances where tea is consumed **with** sugar, and instances where tea is consumed **without** sugar.

#### Evaluating Conclusion Options

The statement that "All people consume tea with added sugar" is incorrect because the word "sometimes" contradicts "all".

Similarly, there is insufficient information to conclude specifically about the sugar consumption habits of children under <InlineMath math="5" /> years old; it is only mentioned that they are not recommended to consume tea excessively.

The most logical conclusion directly supported by the text is that if sugar is added only "sometimes," then **some people consume tea without added sugar**.
