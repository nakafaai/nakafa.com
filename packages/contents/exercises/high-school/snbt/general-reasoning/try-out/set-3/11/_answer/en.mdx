Let's simplify the information:

1.  **All** grade <InlineMath math="9" /> students: Must take School Exam **and** continue to SMA/SMK.

2.  **Some** grade <InlineMath math="9" /> students: Take **Private** SMA/SMK entrance test.

Since Ardian is in grade <InlineMath math="9" />, he **definitely** follows the first rule.

**Conclusion Analysis:**

*"Ardian takes the School Exam and takes the Senior High/Vocational School entrance test."*

1.  **School Exam**: **Definitely True**. All grade <InlineMath math="9" /> students do this.

2.  **Entrance Test**: **Definitely True**. "Continuing to SMA/SMK" implies undergoing an entrance or selection process (in general).

> This conclusion would be **Possibly True** if it specifically mentioned "**Private** Entrance Test" (since only some students do that). However, since the statement is general ("SMA/SMK entrance test"), it is a certainty for those continuing school.

Therefore, the quality of the conclusion is **definitely true**.
