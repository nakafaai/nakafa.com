Let's check each statement based on the table data:

#### Regarding Pashmina vs Square Sales

The data shows <InlineMath math="9 < 12" />, <InlineMath math="14 < 15" />, <InlineMath math="20 < 21" />, and <InlineMath math="27 < 30" />. All are true, so this statement is **Consistent**.

#### Regarding Bergo vs Square Sales

In Week 1 (<InlineMath math="14 > 12" />) and Week 2 (<InlineMath math="16 > 15" />), Bergo sales are indeed higher. However, in Week 3 (<InlineMath math="18 < 21" />) and Week 4 (<InlineMath math="20 < 30" />), Bergo sales are lower. Thus, this statement is **Inconsistent**.

#### Regarding Bergo Sales Pattern

Bergo sales data is <InlineMath math="14, 16, 18, 20" />. The difference between weeks is always constant (<InlineMath math="+2" />), which means it forms an arithmetic progression. This statement is **Consistent**.

#### Regarding Weekly Sales Levels

If we look at all columns, every veil type experiences an increase in sales from week to week without any decrease. This statement is **Consistent**.

#### Regarding Bergo Sales Increase

Total increase for Square is <InlineMath math="30 - 12 = 18" />. Total increase for Pashmina is <InlineMath math="27 - 9 = 18" />. Meanwhile, total increase for Bergo is only <InlineMath math="20 - 14 = 6" />. It is true that Bergo has the smallest increase. This statement is **Consistent**.

In conclusion, the statement that is **most inconsistent** with the table is the claim that Bergo sales are always higher than Square sales.
