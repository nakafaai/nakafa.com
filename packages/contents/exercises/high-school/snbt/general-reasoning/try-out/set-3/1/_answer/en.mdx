To determine the most suitable statement, we need to analyze each option based on the data in the table.

#### Analysis of Options

##### Interest in basketball increases every year

Basketball interest data:
- Class <InlineMath math="\text{X}" />: <InlineMath math="100" />
- Class <InlineMath math="\text{XI}" />: <InlineMath math="150" /> (increase)
- Class <InlineMath math="\text{XII}" />: <InlineMath math="120" /> (decrease)

Interest in basketball does not increase every year because there is a decrease in Class <InlineMath math="\text{XII}" />. This statement is **false**.

##### Dance has the best prospects because interest is always increasing

Dance interest data:
- Class <InlineMath math="\text{X}" />: <InlineMath math="75" />
- Class <InlineMath math="\text{XI}" />: <InlineMath math="78" /> (increase)
- Class <InlineMath math="\text{XII}" />: <InlineMath math="80" /> (increase)

Although interest is always increasing, the term "best prospects" is subjective and not fully supported by this small increase alone, especially compared to the much larger number of basketball participants. Let's look at other options that are more factually certain.

##### Painting has the best prospects because interest is always increasing

Painting interest data:
- Class <InlineMath math="\text{X}" />: <InlineMath math="68" />
- Class <InlineMath math="\text{XI}" />: <InlineMath math="54" /> (decrease)
- Class <InlineMath math="\text{XII}" />: <InlineMath math="44" /> (decrease)

Interest in painting is actually strictly decreasing. This statement is **false**.

##### In every grade level, singing is the least popular hobby

Let's check the hobby with the fewest participants in each class:
- Class <InlineMath math="\text{X}" />: Acting (<InlineMath math="40" />) < Singing (<InlineMath math="57" />)
- Class <InlineMath math="\text{XI}" />: Acting (<InlineMath math="7" />) < Singing (<InlineMath math="46" />)
- Class <InlineMath math="\text{XII}" />: Acting (<InlineMath math="18" />) < Singing (<InlineMath math="44" />)

It turns out that acting has fewer participants than singing in all grades. This statement is **false**.

##### Acting is the least popular among students because it always has the fewest participants in every grade

Based on the previous analysis:
- In Class <InlineMath math="\text{X}" />, acting is the lowest (<InlineMath math="40" />).
- In Class <InlineMath math="\text{XI}" />, acting is the lowest (<InlineMath math="7" />).
- In Class <InlineMath math="\text{XII}" />, acting is the lowest (<InlineMath math="18" />).

This statement is fully consistent with the table data because acting consistently has the lowest number of participants at every grade level.

Therefore, the most appropriate statement is that acting is the least popular among students.
