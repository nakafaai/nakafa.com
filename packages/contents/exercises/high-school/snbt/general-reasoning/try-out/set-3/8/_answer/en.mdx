This question asks us to find the conclusion that is most incorrect. In mathematical logic, this is equivalent to finding the **negation** of the implication derived from the text.

Based on the text, delirium (defined as acute fluctuating changes in consciousness) is a symptom of Covid-19 patients. We can construct the implication:

"If someone experiences delirium (acute fluctuating consciousness), then they are indicated to be infected with Covid-19."

Let:

- <InlineMath math="p" />: Experiencing acute fluctuating changes in consciousness (Delirium).
- <InlineMath math="q" />: Infected with Covid-19.

The valid implication is <InlineMath math="p \rightarrow q" />.

The negation of the implication <InlineMath math="p \rightarrow q" /> is <InlineMath math="p \land \sim q" /> (p **and** not q).

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\sim(p \rightarrow q) \equiv p \land \sim q" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the statement that is most incorrect (the negation) is:

"Experiencing acute fluctuating changes in consciousness **and not** infected with Covid-19."

This statement corresponds to the available option.
