Let's analyze each answer choice based on the data in the table:

**Choice Analysis:**

1.  **First Choice (Incorrect):**

    The statement that the content of every component in jackfruit is **always** higher than in pomelo is false. For example, jackfruit calcium (<InlineMath math="20" />) is lower than pomelo (<InlineMath math="23" />).

2.  **Second Choice (Incorrect):**

    The statement that avocado content is **always** higher than pomelo is also false. Avocado calcium (<InlineMath math="10" />) is lower than pomelo (<InlineMath math="23" />).

3.  **Third Choice (Incorrect):**

    The total protein of pomelo and jackfruit (<InlineMath math="600 + 1200 = 1800" />) is **lower** than avocado and ambarella (<InlineMath math="900 + 1000 = 1900" />).

4.  **Fourth Choice (Correct):**

    Let's calculate the total calcium:

    - Pomelo + Avocado: <InlineMath math="23 + 10 = 33" />

    - Ambarella + Jackfruit: <InlineMath math="15 + 20 = 35" />

    Since <InlineMath math="33 < 35" />, the statement that the total calcium of pomelo and avocado is lower is **correct**.

5.  **Fifth Choice (Incorrect):**

    Avocado has a very high fat content (<InlineMath math="6500" />), so in total, avocado has much more content than jackfruit.

Therefore, the most appropriate conclusion is the option stating this comparison of calcium totals.
