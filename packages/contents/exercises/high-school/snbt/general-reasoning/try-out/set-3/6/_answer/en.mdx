We can analyze the meaning of each word by comparing the two code sentences.

Given:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{it pit sit} = \text{I passed SBMPTN}" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{it nit sit} = \text{I passed SIMAK}" />
</MathContainer>

From the two sentences above, there are common elements:
- Common codes: <InlineMath math="\text{it}" /> and <InlineMath math="\text{sit}" />.
- Common meanings: <InlineMath math="\text{I}" /> and <InlineMath math="\text{passed}" />.

This indicates that <InlineMath math="\text{it}" /> and <InlineMath math="\text{sit}" /> represent the words <InlineMath math="\text{I}" /> and <InlineMath math="\text{passed}" /> (although the specific order cannot be determined).

The different elements are:
- In the first sentence, <InlineMath math="\text{pit}" /> represents <InlineMath math="\text{SBMPTN}" />.
- In the second sentence, <InlineMath math="\text{nit}" /> represents <InlineMath math="\text{SIMAK}" />.

Thus, the word that means <InlineMath math="\text{SIMAK}" /> is <InlineMath math="\text{nit}" />.
