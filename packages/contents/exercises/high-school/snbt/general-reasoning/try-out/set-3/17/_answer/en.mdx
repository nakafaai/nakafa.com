The statement in the text emphasizes two main points that make a boarding house a logical choice for young workers:
1.  **Short distance**: This is considered to save on transport costs.
2.  **Cheap cost**: This is cited as the main priority.

The core argument is a preference for boarding houses that are **close** (to save transport costs) and **cheap**.

Let's analyze the choices to find the one that **weakens** this argument:

-   **Workers choose the closest distance**: Supports the argument (consistent with the short distance premise).
-   **Close distance and cheap cost increase interest**: Supports the argument.
-   **Workers choose a distant boarding house to save costs**: This statement **weakens** the argument that "short distance" is required to "save costs" or is the primary choice. If workers actually choose a **distant** place to save money (perhaps because the rent difference outweighs transport costs), then the premise that they must find a close place to save money is not absolute. This shows a trade-off where distance is sacrificed to meet the main priority (low cost).
-   **Workers choose cheap costs**: Supports the argument (consistent with the main priority).
-   **The chosen boarding house is the closest**: Supports the argument.

Therefore, the argument that weakens the statement is that young workers choose a distant boarding house for the reason of saving costs.
