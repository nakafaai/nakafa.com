The text explicitly states that green tea has many benefits for maintaining skin health from within, **especially if drunk regularly every day**.

Let's analyze each statement:

-   **Eliminate acne**: The text states it "reduces" acne, not "eliminates" it. "Eliminate" implies complete removal, whereas "reduce" means lessening the intensity or amount.
-   **Maintain skin health**: This statement **aligns with the text**, which mentions that regular consumption of green tea is beneficial for maintaining skin health.
-   **Has no benefits**: The text clearly states green tea has "many benefits".
-   **Inhibit premature aging**: The text states green tea "can" inhibit premature aging, so saying this is "possibly false" is incorrect.
-   **Cannot reduce acne**: This directly contradicts the text.

Therefore, the most appropriate conclusion supported by the text is that green tea, if consumed regularly, can maintain skin health.
