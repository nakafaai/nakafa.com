There are three types of lawn mowers: tools <InlineMath math="P" />, <InlineMath math="Q" />, and <InlineMath math="R" />. The cutting capability of tool <InlineMath math="P" /> is <InlineMath math="2" /> times that of tool <InlineMath math="Q" />. Meanwhile, the cutting capability of tool <InlineMath math="R" /> is one-third of tool <InlineMath math="P" />. If the grass area cut using tool <InlineMath math="R" /> is <InlineMath math="200\text{ m}^2" /> in <InlineMath math="4" /> hours, then in <InlineMath math="3" /> hours, tool <InlineMath math="Q" /> can cut a grass area of .... <InlineMath math="\text{m}^2" />.
