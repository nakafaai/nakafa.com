We are asked to find the statement that is **NOT in accordance** with the data in the table. Let's analyze the available choices.

##### Basketball is the most popular interest
Let's calculate the total number of students for each interest:
- Basketball: <InlineMath math="100 + 150 + 120 = 370" />
- Dance: <InlineMath math="75 + 78 + 80 = 233" />
- Painting: <InlineMath math="68 + 54 + 44 = 166" />
- Singing: <InlineMath math="57 + 46 + 44 = 147" />
- Acting: <InlineMath math="40 + 7 + 18 = 65" />

Basketball has the highest number of interested students (<InlineMath math="370" />). This statement is **in accordance**.

##### The number of students interested in acting is 65 students
The total number of students interested in acting is <InlineMath math="40 + 7 + 18 = 65" /> students. This statement is **in accordance**.

##### The number of class XII students according to interest is 306
Let's calculate the total number of students in class <InlineMath math="\text{XII}" />:
<BlockMath math="120 + 80 + 44 + 44 + 18 = 306" />

This statement is **in accordance**.

##### The least interest in dance is in class X
Let's look at the dance interest data per class:
- Class <InlineMath math="\text{X}" />: <InlineMath math="75" />
- Class <InlineMath math="\text{XI}" />: <InlineMath math="78" />
- Class <InlineMath math="\text{XII}" />: <InlineMath math="80" />

The lowest interest is in class <InlineMath math="\text{X}" /> (<InlineMath math="75" />).
This statement is **in accordance**.

##### The number of students interested in painting is 160
Based on previous calculations, the total number of students interested in painting is:
<BlockMath math="68 + 54 + 44 = 166" />

The statement says the number is <InlineMath math="160" />, while the data shows <InlineMath math="166" />.
This statement is **NOT in accordance** with the data.

Therefore, the correct choice is the statement regarding the number of students interested in painting.
