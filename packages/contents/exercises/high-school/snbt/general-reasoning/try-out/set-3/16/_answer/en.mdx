Based on the text, the nutritional content can be summarized as follows:
-   **Jicama**: Low calories, High protein, **Low fat**.
-   **Apple**: High calories, Low protein, **Low fat**.

The premise states that a child consumes **jicama**. This means the child receives an intake that is high in protein, low in calories, and **low in fat**.

Let's analyze the choices to find the **incorrect** statement:

-   **Gets low calories and high protein**: True, consistent with jicama's content.
-   **Some children have high calories**: This statement is general ("some children"). Even though the child eating jicama gets low calories, this statement doesn't explicitly contradict logic as it could refer to possibilities outside this specific case.
-   **Does not get fat**: **False**. Jicama contains **low fat**. The word "low" implies a quantity exists (greater than zero), whereas "does not get" implies zero. This statement contradicts the fact that jicama contains fat.
-   **Gets low fat**: True, consistent with jicama's content.
-   **Gets low calories and low fat**: True, consistent with jicama's content.

Therefore, the incorrect statement is that there are children who do not get fat.
