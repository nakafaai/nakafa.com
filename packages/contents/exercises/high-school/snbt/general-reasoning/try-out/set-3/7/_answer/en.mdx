This question asks us to find the conclusion that is most incorrect, which in mathematical logic is equivalent to finding the **negation** of the implication found in the text.

The main statement in the text is:

"A number of articles in the RKUHP are lighter than the Corruption Law, **so** it will make corruption in Indonesia more rampant."

We can model this statement as an implication <InlineMath math="p \rightarrow q" />:

- <InlineMath math="p" />: A number of articles in the RKUHP are lighter than the Corruption Law.
- <InlineMath math="q" />: Corruption in Indonesia is becoming more rampant.

The negation of the implication <InlineMath math="p \rightarrow q" /> is <InlineMath math="p \land \sim q" /> (p **and** not q).

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\sim(p \rightarrow q) \equiv p \land \sim q" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the conclusion that is most incorrect is:
"A number of articles in the RKUHP are lighter than the Corruption Law **and** corruption in Indonesia is **not** becoming more rampant (decreasing)."

This statement corresponds to the option stating: "Some articles of the RKUHP are lighter than the Corruption Law and corruption in Indonesia is decreasing."
