To determine the conclusion that is most likely true, we need to analyze the core information presented in the text.

The text explicitly states that:

> "Our fuel consumption has exceeded domestic fuel production, so to cover the difference between consumption and production, we must import fuel from abroad."

This statement establishes a cause-and-effect relationship:

1.  **Cause**: Fuel consumption exceeds (is higher than) domestic production.
2.  **Effect**: Fuel imports are carried out to cover the gap.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **Statement regarding import fluctuation**: The text does not provide specific data regarding the fluctuation of imports over time.
*   **Statement regarding annual increase**: The text does not mention an increasing trend occurring *every year* specifically for these three variables.
*   **Statement regarding the year 2005**: The text does not mention the year 2005 at all.
*   **Statement regarding consumption being higher than production**: This aligns with the text's premise that "Our fuel consumption has exceeded domestic fuel production," which is the main reason (cause) for importing fuel.

Therefore, the conclusion most supported by the text is that fuel consumption being always higher than production necessitates imports.
