Let's unravel this ticket distribution puzzle. We have 5 children (A, B, C, D, E) and 5 destinations. The main condition is that each city must be visited by exactly one child (one-to-one correspondence).

First, let's identify children with "exclusive" or unique choices:
1.  **Bali**: Only appears in **B**'s wish list. Thus, **B must go to Bali**.
2.  **Manado**: Only appears in **C**'s wish list. Thus, **C must go to Manado**.

Now we are left with 3 children (A, D, E) and 3 cities (Yogyakarta, Lombok, Padang).
-   A wants: Yogyakarta or Lombok.
-   D wants: Yogyakarta or Padang.
-   E wants: Padang, Lombok, or Yogyakarta.

Based on the additional information in the question, we know that **E goes to Lombok**.

Since **Lombok** is taken by E, let's look at A's options:
-   A originally wanted Yogyakarta or Lombok.
-   The Lombok option is closed (since E is there).
-   Therefore, the only remaining choice for A is **Yogyakarta**.

Thus, the father gives the **Yogyakarta** ticket to A. (As a completion, D will automatically get the ticket to Padang).
