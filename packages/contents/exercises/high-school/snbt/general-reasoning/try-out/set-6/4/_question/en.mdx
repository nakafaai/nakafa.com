A number of studies have proven that frequent consumption of fast food does not have an immediate impact on the body. However, the fast food consumed will accumulate in the body, which later becomes the cause of deadly diseases such as cancer. Not only cancer, dangerous diseases also lurk, for example, stroke, appendicitis, and kidney disease. So if you are one of those people who like to consume fast food, reduce it and start loving your body and yourself.

The wax destroys the working principle of the body's digestive system so that food containing wax will be digested with a minimum time of two days.

Based on the text above, what will happen if wax enters the body?
