This question asks us to draw a conclusion based on a hypothetical condition ("if improvements do not occur").

Let's analyze the logical relationship in the text:

1.  **Real Condition (with improvement)**: Even though there are improvements, poverty is still rife and inequality continues.
2.  **Hypothetical Condition (without improvement)**: If even *with* improvements the condition is still bad (poverty is rife, inequality continues), then logically, **without any improvement**, the condition would become worse or more severe.

Analysis of Options:

*   **Statement regarding wage/exchange rate factors**: This relates to causes, not the direct impact of "lack of improvement" on the poverty status itself in the context of the first sentence.
*   **Statement regarding poverty decreasing**: This contradicts logic. Without improvement, conditions cannot possibly get better.
*   **Statement regarding poverty continuing**: This is the condition that happens *when there are improvements*. If there are no improvements, the condition should be more than just "continuing".
*   **Statement regarding poverty being very high**: This is the most likely conclusion. If "with improvement" = "still rife/continuing", then "without improvement" = "very high/severe". The intensity of the problem would increase.

Therefore, the most likely conclusion is that poverty and inequality would be very high.
