To find the true statement, we must verify each answer choice based on the information explicitly stated in the text.

Analysis of options:

*   **Statement regarding countries retaliating**: The text uses the word "**if**" ("...if other countries retaliate..."). This indicates that it is a possibility or hypothetical condition, not a fact that has already happened.
*   **Statement regarding the cause of farmers' losses**: The text states farmers lost money because "chicken prices at the farmer level collapsed". Although it mentions Indonesia lost at the WTO, the text does not directly state that the defeat was the direct cause of the price collapse that occurred a month earlier. The text focuses on farmers' protests due to falling prices.
*   **Statement regarding trade balance being determined by retaliation**: The text states "will affect", not "determined by". Furthermore, this is still in the context of a hypothesis ("if").
*   **Statement regarding retaliation affecting trade balance**: Similar to the previous point, this is based on a conditional sentence ("Of course, this will affect..."), which depends on retaliation occurring.
*   **Statement regarding farmers experiencing losses**: The text explicitly states: "...chicken prices at the farmer level collapsed **causing farmers to lose money**." This is a fact presented in the text.

Therefore, the statement that is certainly true according to the text is that independent chicken farmers experienced losses.
