To find the **inconsistent** statement, we simply need to observe the mismatched trends between two key variables: **Rice Production** and **Rice Procurement**.

Observe the data from **2002 to 2004**:
- **Rice Production** experienced an **increase** (<InlineMath math="33.47 \to 35.32" /> million tons).
- **Rice Procurement** actually experienced a **decrease** (<InlineMath math="35.28 \to 33.69" /> million tons).

This fact indicates an **inverse relationship**. When production reached its highest point, procurement hit its lowest.

Therefore, the statement that *"high rice production is consistent with high rice procurement"* directly contradicts the table data.
