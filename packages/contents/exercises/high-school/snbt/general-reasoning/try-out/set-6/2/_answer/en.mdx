Let's analyze the shipping traffic volume for each month based on the given information. We will use inequality signs to compare the busyness between months.

| Statement | Mathematical Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| December is busier than November | <InlineMath math="\text{December} > \text{November}" /> |
| October is busier than December | <InlineMath math="\text{October} > \text{December}" /> |
| January is not busier than November | <InlineMath math="\text{January} \le \text{November}" /> |
| January is busier than February | <InlineMath math="\text{January} > \text{February}" /> |

Based on the points above, we can arrange the order of busyness from the **busiest** to the **quietest**:

1.  From the first two points, we get the order:

    <MathContainer>
      <BlockMath math="\text{October} > \text{December} > \text{November}" />
    </MathContainer>

2.  From the last two points, we know that January is below or equal to November, and February is below January:

    <MathContainer>
      <BlockMath math="\text{November} \ge \text{January} > \text{February}" />
    </MathContainer>

If we combine all this information, the complete order is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{October} \xrightarrow{\text{busier}} \text{December} \xrightarrow{\text{busier}} \text{November} \xrightarrow{\text{busier/equal}} \text{January} \xrightarrow{\text{busier}} \text{February}" />
</MathContainer>

From this sequence, we can determine the ranking of busyness:
1.  **Busiest:** October
2.  **Second busiest:** December
3.  Third: November
4.  Fourth: January
5.  Fifth: February

> **Conclusion:** The shipping traffic estimated to be the **second busiest** occurs in the month of **December**.

Therefore, the correct answer is **December**.
