Based on the text, there is specific information regarding the impact of wax content in instant food on the body:

"The wax destroys the working principle of the body's digestive system so that food containing wax will be digested with a minimum time of two days."

This statement indicates that the presence of wax disrupts the digestive system and makes the digestion process take much longer (a minimum of two days). In other words, wax **slows down the digestion process**.

> Other options are incorrect because the text specifically links wax to digestive system disruption and long digestion duration, not to stroke symptoms, kidney disease (mentioned as a general impact of fast food, not specifically wax), appetite, or the inability to digest at all.

Therefore, the correct answer is **slows down the digestion process**.
