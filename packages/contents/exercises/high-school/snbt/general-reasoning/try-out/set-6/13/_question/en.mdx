Dark clouds seem to be increasingly covering the poultry farming industry, especially for independent farmers. The reason is, a month earlier, these independent chicken farmers had protested to the government because chicken prices at the farmer level collapsed, causing farmers to lose money. It is not surprising that farmers are anxious about the relaxation of chicken meat imports. The Indonesian People's Poultry Association (Pinsar) assesses that the entry of chicken imports has the potential to disrupt the absorption of meat from local farmers. However, University of Indonesia Lecturer Fithra Faisal Hastiadi said that Indonesia was forced to ratify chicken meat import provisions because it had lost in the World Trade Organization Dispute Settlement Body (WTO DSB) Session. Not to mention, if other countries retaliate by making it difficult for exports from Indonesia to enter the countries concerned. Of course, this will affect Indonesia's trade balance performance, which is currently still in deficit.
