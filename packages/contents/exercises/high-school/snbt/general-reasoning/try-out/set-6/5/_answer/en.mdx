Let's verify the validity of each statement by comparing it directly against the table data:

| Statement (Claim) | Data Fact Check | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basketball interest always increases** | Data: <InlineMath math="100 \to 150 \to 120" />. There is a decrease in Grade XII. | Incorrect |
| **Dance/Painting has best prospects** | Painting decreases (<InlineMath math="68 \to 44" />). Dance increases, but total numbers are far below Basketball. | Incorrect |
| **Singing is the least popular** | In all grades, Acting numbers are always lower than Singing. | Incorrect |
| **Acting is the least popular** | Acting numbers (<InlineMath math="40, 7, 18" />) are the **lowest** in every grade column. | **Correct** |

> The data consistently shows that Acting occupies the bottom rank in the number of participants at every grade level, making it the statement most consistent with the table contents.
