We need to determine how many card number combinations can be made based on the given rules.

The card number consists of <InlineMath math="12" /> digits with the following format:
1.  **First 4 digits (Prefix)**: Fixed, which is <InlineMath math="0844" />.
2.  **Last 4 digits (Suffix)**: Fixed, which is <InlineMath math="1221" />.
3.  **Middle 4 digits**: The part that needs to be arranged.

Since the first 4 and last 4 digits are already determined, we only need to fill the <InlineMath math="12 - 4 - 4 = 4" /> empty positions in the middle.

The available digits to fill these positions are <InlineMath math="\{2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9\}" />. The number of available digit choices is <InlineMath math="7" />.

Since there is no restriction on repeating digits in arranging phone numbers, each of the 4 middle positions can be filled by any of the <InlineMath math="7" /> available digits.

The calculation is as follows:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Combinations} = 7 \times 7 \times 7 \times 7" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Combinations} = 7^4" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Combinations} = 2401" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the number of card numbers that can be created is <InlineMath math="2401" />.
