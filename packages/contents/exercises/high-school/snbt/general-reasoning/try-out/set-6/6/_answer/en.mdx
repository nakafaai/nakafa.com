Let's verify each statement based on the table data to find the one that is **NOT** in accordance.

| Statement | Data Fact Check | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basketball most popular** | Total: <InlineMath math="100+150+120 = 370" />. This is the highest number compared to others. | True |
| **Acting fans are 65** | Total: <InlineMath math="40+7+18 = 65" />. | True |
| **Grade XII students 306** | Total: <InlineMath math="120+80+44+44+18 = 306" />. | True |
| **Lowest dance in Grade X** | Grade X (<InlineMath math="75" />) < XI (<InlineMath math="78" />) < XII (<InlineMath math="80" />). | True |
| **Painting fans are 160** | Total: <InlineMath math="68+54+44 = 166" />. This number is **not equal** to 160. | **False** |

> Based on the calculations above, the statement that the number of students who like painting is 160 is incorrect (it should be 166).
