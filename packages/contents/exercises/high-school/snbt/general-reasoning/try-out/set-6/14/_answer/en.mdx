We can analyze the logic behind this situation using the principle of **Disjunctive Syllogism**. Imagine there are two possible paths the Director of PT Batik must take this year:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P \lor Q" />
</MathContainer>

Where:
- <InlineMath math="P" />: Opening a new branch.
- <InlineMath math="Q" />: Selling a new product.
- <InlineMath math="\lor" />: Represents "or" (one of them must happen).

The subsequent fact states that the new branch permit was not completed. This means the first path (<InlineMath math="P" />) is blocked or false (<InlineMath math="\sim P" />).

Since one of these two plans **must** be executed (based on the initial "or" premise), and the branch opening plan failed, logic dictates that the **only remaining possibility** is that the second plan must proceed.

Therefore, the absolutely correct conclusion is **PT Batik sells the new product this year**.
