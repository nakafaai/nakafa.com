To answer this question, we need to focus on the end of the text which specifically discusses the impact of wax on the body. The text explicitly states:

> "The wax destroys the working principle of the body's digestive system so that food containing wax will be digested in a **minimum of two days**."

Digestion taking a minimum of two days indicates a significant **time delay** compared to the normal process. In other words, the digestion process becomes much slower than usual.

Therefore, the direct impact of wax entering the body is **slowing down the digestion process**. Other options such as inhibiting stroke or reducing appetite are not mentioned in the context of the wax's effects.
