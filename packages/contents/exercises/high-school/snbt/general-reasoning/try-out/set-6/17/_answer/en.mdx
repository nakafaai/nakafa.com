Let's use **Disjunctive Syllogism** logic to solve this case. Imagine the event in Kampung Bambu as a binary choice where one of them must happen:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P \lor Q" />
</MathContainer>

Where:
- <InlineMath math="P" />: Robbery occurred.
- <InlineMath math="Q" />: Theft occurred.
- <InlineMath math="\lor" />: Means "or" (one must be true).

The second premise provides a key fact: **Robbery never occurred** (<InlineMath math="\sim P" />).

Since the first option (<InlineMath math="P" />) has been annulled or declared false, logic dictates that the only remaining possibility for the initial statement to remain true is that the second option (<InlineMath math="Q" />) must have occurred.

Therefore, the inevitable conclusion is: **Last Sunday, a crime in the form of theft just occurred in Kampung Bambu**.
