Let's analyze the cooking time information for each type of meat based on the statements in the problem. Let <InlineMath math="T(x)" /> be the cooking time for meat <InlineMath math="x" />.

| Statement | Mathematical Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| Beef cooks longer than lamb | <InlineMath math="T(\text{Beef}) > T(\text{Lamb})" /> |
| Beef cooks not longer than duck | <InlineMath math="T(\text{Beef}) \le T(\text{Duck})" /> |
| Rabbit cooks faster than chicken | <InlineMath math="T(\text{Rabbit}) < T(\text{Chicken})" /> |
| Rabbit cooks longer than duck | <InlineMath math="T(\text{Rabbit}) > T(\text{Duck})" /> |

Based on the table above, we can arrange the cooking order from the **fastest** (least time) to the **slowest**:

1.  From the first and second points, we get the order:

    <MathContainer>
      <BlockMath math="T(\text{Lamb}) < T(\text{Beef}) \le T(\text{Duck})" />
    </MathContainer>

2.  From the third and fourth points, we get the order:

    <MathContainer>
      <BlockMath math="T(\text{Duck}) < T(\text{Rabbit}) < T(\text{Chicken})" />
    </MathContainer>

If we combine both sequences, we get the complete order as follows:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Lamb} \xrightarrow{\text{slower}} \text{Beef} \xrightarrow{\text{slower}} \text{Duck} \xrightarrow{\text{slower}} \text{Rabbit} \xrightarrow{\text{slower}} \text{Chicken}" />
</MathContainer>

> **Conclusion:** The meat that cooks the fastest is the one at the very beginning of the sequence, which is **Lamb**.

Therefore, the correct answer is **Lamb**.
