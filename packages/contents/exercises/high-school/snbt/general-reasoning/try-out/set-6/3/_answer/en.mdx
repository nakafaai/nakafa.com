Let's analyze the given information using mathematical logic.

The problem states that the activity to be held is either **cleaning the gutters** (<InlineMath math="p" />) **or** **collecting used goods** (<InlineMath math="q" />). This can be written as a disjunction:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="p \lor q" />
</MathContainer>

Then, it is known as a fact that **cleaning the gutters could not be carried out** (<InlineMath math="\sim p" />) because it rained.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\sim p" />
</MathContainer>

In logic, this is called a **Disjunctive Syllogism**. Since one option (cleaning gutters) did not happen, the other option (collecting used goods) **must happen** for the plan to remain valid.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{aligned} & p \lor q \\ & \sim p \\ \hline \therefore \ & q \end{aligned}" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the conclusion is <InlineMath math="q" />: **On Sunday, community service to collect used goods is held.**

> Options stating that "community service is not held" are incorrect because the option to "collect used goods" can (and must) still be carried out according to the initial plan.

Therefore, the correct answer is **Community service to collect used goods is held on Sunday**.
