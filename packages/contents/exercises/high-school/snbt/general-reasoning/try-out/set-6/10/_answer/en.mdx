We can solve this code by comparing the two given sentences:

1.  **it pit sit** = **I passed SBMPTN**
2.  **it nit sit** = **I passed SIMAK**

From these two sentences, there are common words:
-   Common codes: **it** and **sit**
-   Common meanings: **I** and **passed**

This means **it** and **sit** represent **I** and **passed** (although we don't know exactly which is which, it is not needed to answer this question).

The remaining word in the second sentence is:
-   Remaining code: **nit**
-   Remaining meaning: **SIMAK**

Thus, **nit** means **SIMAK**.
