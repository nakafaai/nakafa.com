Climatologically, Arabia is a desert region with extreme temperature characteristics. When entering summer, it becomes very hot, and vice versa. Desert regions tend to have little vegetation. Even if there is any, it is small.

Late last year, this Arabian region faced extreme rain where the rain intensity increased highly. This caused floods. It was identified that the floods caused an increase in soil moisture, thereby causing green vegetation to appear in the western part of Arabia.

Based on the text, if the rain intensity in Arabia **does not increase extremely**, which conclusion is appropriate?
