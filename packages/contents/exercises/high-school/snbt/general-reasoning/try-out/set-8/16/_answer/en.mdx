Based on the text, there are requirements for a building to be categorized as a temple, namely it must have a domed roof and be towering high. The text also mentions that some temples have a height exceeding one hundred meters.

Currently, it is known that Andi is inside a building that is one hundred meters high. This information only explains the height aspect of the building, which might fit the "towering high" criterion. However, to confirm that the building is a temple, it must also have a domed roof. Information regarding the shape of the roof of the building where Andi is located is not available in the text.

Without information on whether the building has a domed roof or not, we cannot assess the validity of the conclusion. The building could be a temple, or it could simply be a regular skyscraper. Therefore, the conclusion cannot be assessed because the information is insufficient.
