We can analyze the text using a chain of syllogisms (cause-and-effect logic). Let's break down the premises found in the text:

#### Identifying Premises

Based on the text, we can construct the logical flow as follows:

*   **Premise 1** (<InlineMath math="P \rightarrow Q" />): Consuming high-fat food (<InlineMath math="P" />) causes excess calories (<InlineMath math="Q" />).
*   **Premise 2** (<InlineMath math="Q \rightarrow R" />): Excess calories (<InlineMath math="Q" />) cause weight gain (<InlineMath math="R" />).
*   **Premise 3** (<InlineMath math="R \rightarrow S" />): Weight gain (<InlineMath math="R" />) makes the body difficult to move actively (<InlineMath math="S" />).

#### Drawing a Conclusion

Using the rule of hypothetical syllogism (chain reasoning), we can connect the initial premises directly to the final conclusion. If we connect **Premise 2** and **Premise 3**:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{array}{rl} \text{Premise 2} : & Q \rightarrow R \\ \text{Premise 3} : & R \rightarrow S \\ \hline \therefore & Q \rightarrow S \end{array}" />
</MathContainer>

This means: **"Excess calories (Q) result in the body being difficult to move actively (S)."**

#### Analyzing Statements

Let's evaluate each statement based on the logical conclusion above:

*   **Increase energy during the day**: Incorrect. The text explicitly states that high-fat foods cause *lethargy*, which is the opposite of increased energy.
*   **Good impact on body health**: Incorrect. The text does not mention any positive impact; instead, the narrative focuses on negative effects like lethargy and difficulty moving.
*   **Lethargy is always caused by high-fat foods**: Incorrect. The word "always" is a generalization unsupported by the text. The text only states "can cause," not that it is the sole cause.
*   **Consuming enough fatty foods**: Incorrect. The premises focus on consuming *high* or *excess* fat, not *enough* or *sufficient* fat.

The statement that **excess calories due to fat can result in the body being difficult to move actively** is the most accurate because it aligns with the logical flow <InlineMath math="Q \rightarrow S" /> derived above.

> It is important to distinguish between "some" (can cause) and "all" (always causes) when drawing logical conclusions.
