To answer this question correctly, we need to dissect the cause-and-effect logical structure in the text. Let's define the premises:

*   <InlineMath math="P" />: Rain intensity in Arabia increases extremely.
*   <InlineMath math="Q" />: Floods occur.
*   <InlineMath math="R" />: Green vegetation appears in the Arabian region.

#### Analyzing the Logical Flow

Based on the text, the sequence of events is:
1.  Extreme rain (<InlineMath math="P" />) causes floods (<InlineMath math="Q" />).
2.  Floods (<InlineMath math="Q" />) cause the appearance of green vegetation (<InlineMath math="R" />).

Mathematically, this can be written as a chain implication:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P \rightarrow Q \rightarrow R \implies P \rightarrow R" />
</MathContainer>

This means: **"If rain intensity increases extremely (P), then green vegetation will appear (R)."**

#### Testing the Question

The question asks what happens if **rain intensity does NOT increase extremely** (<InlineMath math="\sim P" />).

In formal logic, if we have the premise <InlineMath math="P \rightarrow R" /> and the condition <InlineMath math="\sim P" /> (negation of the antecedent), we **CANNOT** conclude <InlineMath math="\sim R" /> (negation of the consequent). This is known as the logical fallacy of *Denying the Antecedent*.

Why? Because the text only tells us what happens *if* there is extreme rain. The text does *not* state that extreme rain is the **only** cause of green vegetation. It is possible that other factors (like artificial irrigation) could cause vegetation to appear even without extreme rain.

Therefore, if <InlineMath math="\sim P" /> occurs, the status of <InlineMath math="R" /> (whether there is vegetation or not) becomes uncertain or unknown based on the available information.

> Since we do not have information about what happens if the rain is not extreme, the answer is **cannot be concluded**.
