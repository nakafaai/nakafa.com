The psychologist's opinion states that **millennial workers tend to have high organizational commitment**. High organizational commitment is typically characterized by loyalty, good performance, and positive contribution to the company.

To weaken this opinion, we need to find a statement that presents contradictory evidence, specifically signs of low commitment or poor performance.

Statements suggesting that millennial workers have interesting ideas, high work ethic, or work for long periods actually support the psychologist's opinion, as these are traits of high commitment. Similarly, if few companies complain about their performance, it implies that most companies are satisfied, which also strengthens the argument.

In contrast, if **many companies complain about the performance and contribution of millennial workers**, this indicates dissatisfaction with their work results. Complaints regarding performance and contribution are clear indicators that their organizational commitment may not be as high as claimed. This fact directly contradicts the psychologist's opinion.

Therefore, the statement that weakens the psychologist's opinion is:

> Many companies complain about the performance and contribution of millennial workers
