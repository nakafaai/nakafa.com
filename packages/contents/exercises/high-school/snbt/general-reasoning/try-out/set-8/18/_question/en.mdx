The final score of high-achieving students in a school is determined by summing the academic achievement score and the activity participation score. The weight for academic achievement is <InlineMath math="70\%" />, while the weight for non-academic activity participation is <InlineMath math="30\%" />. Below are the scores of the five best students in the school.

| Student | Academic Score | Non-Academic Score |
| :-----: | :------------: | :----------------: |
|    <InlineMath math="\text{A}" />    |       <InlineMath math="70" />       |         <InlineMath math="80" />         |
|    <InlineMath math="\text{B}" />    |       <InlineMath math="80" />       |         <InlineMath math="80" />         |
|    <InlineMath math="\text{C}" />    |       <InlineMath math="90" />       |         <InlineMath math="50" />         |
|    <InlineMath math="\text{D}" />    |       <InlineMath math="90" />       |         <InlineMath math="60" />         |
|    <InlineMath math="\text{E}" />    |       <InlineMath math="80" />       |         <InlineMath math="70" />         |
