We can solve this problem using syllogistic logic. Let's first define the premises:

*   <InlineMath math="P" />: Students manage their time well.
*   <InlineMath math="Q" />: Students study very hard.
*   <InlineMath math="R" />: Students achieve high exam scores.

#### Analyzing Premises

Based on the text, we derive the following implications:

1.  "Students will achieve high exam scores if they study very hard" can be written as <InlineMath math="Q \rightarrow R" />.
2.  "This condition (studying hard) occurs when students can manage their time well" can be written as <InlineMath math="P \rightarrow Q" />.

#### Drawing a Conclusion

By combining these two premises, we get a logical chain:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P \rightarrow Q \rightarrow R \implies P \rightarrow R" />
</MathContainer>

The initial conclusion is: **"If students can manage their time well, then they will achieve high exam scores."**

#### Logical Equivalence (Contrapositive)

In mathematical logic, an implication statement <InlineMath math="P \rightarrow R" /> is equivalent to its contrapositive, which is <InlineMath math="\sim R \rightarrow \sim P" />.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\sim R \rightarrow \sim P" />
</MathContainer>

This translates to: **"If students do NOT achieve high exam scores, then they can NOT manage their time well."**

This statement matches the option stating that students who do not achieve high exam scores mean they cannot manage their time well.

> Remember the principles of Modus Tollens and Contrapositive: If <InlineMath math="A \rightarrow B" /> is true, then <InlineMath math="\sim B \rightarrow \sim A" /> must also be true.
