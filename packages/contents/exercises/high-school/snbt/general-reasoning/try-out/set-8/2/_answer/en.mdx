To calculate the percentage increase in sales for flower shop B in year 4, we compare the difference in sales between year 4 and year 3 (the previous year), then divide by the sales of year 3.

- Sales of flower shop B in year 4 = <InlineMath math="385" />

The calculation is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{aligned} \text{Percentage Increase} &= \frac{\text{Sales Yr 4} - \text{Sales Yr 3}}{\text{Sales Yr 3}} \times 100\% \\ &= \frac{385 - 350}{350} \times 100\% \\ &= \frac{35}{350} \times 100\% \\ &= \frac{1}{10} \times 100\% \\ &= 10\% \end{aligned}" />

Therefore, the percentage increase in sales for flower shop B in year 4 compared to the previous year is **<InlineMath math="10\%" />**.
