To determine M's vote count, we must build equations connecting all variables. Let's analyze the dependency logic:

#### Determining Total Votes

To calculate the absolute value (exact number) of any candidate's votes, we need **Statement 4**, which gives the total votes:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Votes} = 480" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating O and P's Votes

We know the relationship for the sum of all votes:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="M + N + O + P = \text{Total Votes}" />
</MathContainer>

We need to know the values of O and P to isolate M and N:

*   **Statement 2** is needed to calculate O (using Total Votes from Statement 4).
*   **Statement 3** is needed to calculate P (using the value of O derived from Statement 2).

Without O and P, our equation still has too many unknown variables.

#### Solving for M

After knowing the values of Total, O, and P, the equation becomes:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="M + N = \text{Remaining Votes}" />
</MathContainer>

We still have two variables (M and N) in one equation. To get a specific value for M, we need the relationship between M and N.

**Statement 1** provides this relationship:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="M = 2N \quad \text{or} \quad N = \frac{1}{2}M" />
</MathContainer>

By substituting N into the remaining votes equation, we can solve for M.

#### Conclusion

We need **Statement 4** (Total), **Statement 2** (for O), **Statement 3** (for P), and **Statement 1** (for the M and N relation) all together to find the solution.

Therefore, the information needed is **1, 2, 3, and 4**.
