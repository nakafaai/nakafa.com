To determine the most outstanding student, we need to calculate the final score for each student based on the given weights. The final score is calculated using the formula:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Final Score} = (\text{Academic Score} \times 70\%) + (\text{Non-Academic Score} \times 30\%)" />
</MathContainer>

Let's calculate the final score for each student:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{align*} \text{Student A} &= (70 \times 0.7) + (80 \times 0.3) = 49 + 24 = 73 \\ \text{Student B} &= (80 \times 0.7) + (80 \times 0.3) = 56 + 24 = 80 \\ \text{Student C} &= (90 \times 0.7) + (50 \times 0.3) = 63 + 15 = 78 \\ \text{Student D} &= (90 \times 0.7) + (60 \times 0.3) = 63 + 18 = 81 \\ \text{Student E} &= (80 \times 0.7) + (70 \times 0.3) = 56 + 21 = 77 \end{align*}" />
</MathContainer>

Based on the calculations above, Student <InlineMath math="\text{D}" /> obtained the highest final score of <InlineMath math="81" />. Therefore, Student <InlineMath math="\text{D}" /> is the most outstanding student among the five.
