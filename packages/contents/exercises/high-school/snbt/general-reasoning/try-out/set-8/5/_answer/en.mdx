Our goal is to find the number of votes obtained by O. Let's analyze each statement related to O:

**Analysis of Statement 2:**

"O received one-fourth of the total votes."

Mathematically, this can be written as:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="O = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total Votes}" />
</MathContainer>

This statement gives the relationship between O's votes and the Total Votes, but we do not yet know the value of **Total Votes**.

**Analysis of Statement 4:**

"There were <InlineMath math="480" /> votes cast."

This statement provides the exact value for **Total Votes**:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Votes} = 480" />
</MathContainer>

**Conclusion:**

By combining **Statement 2** and **Statement 4**, we can calculate O's votes:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="O = \frac{1}{4} \times 480 = 120 \text{ votes}" />
</MathContainer>

Statements 1 and 3 are not needed as they only provide information about the relationships between other candidates' votes (M, N, P) which do not directly affect the calculation of O's absolute vote count without first knowing the total votes.

Therefore, the information needed is **2 and 4**.
