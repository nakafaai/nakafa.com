To calculate the percentage increase in sales for flower shop C in year 3, we need to compare the difference in sales between year 3 and year 2, then divide by the sales of year 2 (the previous year).

Based on the chart:
- Sales of flower shop C in year 2 = <InlineMath math="280" />
- Sales of flower shop C in year 3 = <InlineMath math="320" />

The calculation is as follows:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{aligned} \text{Percentage Increase} &= \frac{\text{Sales Yr 3} - \text{Sales Yr 2}}{\text{Sales Yr 2}} \times 100\% \\ &= \frac{320 - 280}{280} \times 100\% \\ &= \frac{40}{280} \times 100\% \\ &= \frac{1}{7} \times 100\% \\ &\approx 14.28\% \end{aligned}" />
</MathContainer>

The result is approximately <InlineMath math="14\%" />.

Therefore, the percentage increase in sales for flower shop C in year 3 compared to the previous year is **<InlineMath math="14\%" />**.
