The doctor's opinion states that consuming vegetables and fruits rich in antioxidants (such as pineapples) can prevent cancer, premature aging, and chronic diseases due to their ability to counteract free radicals. Essentially, consuming fruits and vegetables has a positive impact on health and prevents diseases.

To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that demonstrates a negative impact or the ineffectiveness of consuming fruits and vegetables in preventing these diseases.

Statements claiming that antioxidants counteract free radicals, pineapples prevent premature aging, or that a healthy diet involves fruits and vegetables, all support or align with the doctor's opinion.

In contrast, the statement that **someone who consumes vegetables and fruits has the potential to develop chronic diseases** directly contradicts the doctor's claim. The doctor argues that fruits and vegetables prevent chronic diseases, whereas this statement suggests they potentially cause chronic diseases. This undermines the basis of the doctor's recommendation to consume these foods for health.

Therefore, this statement weakens the doctor's opinion.

> Someone who consumes vegetables and fruits has the potential to develop chronic diseases
