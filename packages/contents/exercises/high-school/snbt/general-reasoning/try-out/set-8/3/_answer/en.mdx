To find the next value, let's analyze the pattern between the terms in the sequence:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{array}{ccl} 4 \xrightarrow{+2} 6 & \quad & (\text{1st to 2nd term}) \\ 6 \xrightarrow{+4} 10 & \quad & (\text{2nd to 3rd term}) \\ 10 \xrightarrow{-1} 9 & \quad & (\text{3rd to 4th term}) \\ 9 \xrightarrow{+2} 11 & \quad & (\text{4th to 5th term}) \\ 11 \xrightarrow{+4} 15 & \quad & (\text{5th to 6th term}) \\ 15 \xrightarrow{-1} 14 & \quad & (\text{6th to 7th term}) \end{array}" />
</MathContainer>

We can see that the pattern is a repeating cycle of operations: **<InlineMath math="+2, +4, -1" />**.

Based on this pattern, the operation following **<InlineMath math="-1" />** cycles back to **<InlineMath math="+2" />**.

Therefore, the next term is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="14 + 2 = 16" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the correct value to complete the sequence is **<InlineMath math="16" />**.
