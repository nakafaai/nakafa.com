To answer this question, we need to map the cause-and-effect logical flow presented in the text. Let's define the premises:

*   <InlineMath math="P" />: The Jakarta area and its surroundings are experiencing the rainy season.
*   <InlineMath math="Q" />: Rivers cannot accommodate rainwater and floods occur.
*   <InlineMath math="R" />: Residents are forced to evacuate to a safe place.

#### Logical Analysis

Based on the text, the relationship between premises can be depicted as a chain implication:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P \rightarrow Q \rightarrow R" />
</MathContainer>

This means:
1.  **If** it is the rainy season (<InlineMath math="P" />), **then** rivers overflow and flood (<InlineMath math="Q" />).
2.  **If** it floods (<InlineMath math="Q" />), **then** residents evacuate (<InlineMath math="R" />).

#### Syllogism Conclusion

Using the principle of hypothetical syllogism, we can draw a direct conclusion from start to finish:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="(P \rightarrow Q) \land (Q \rightarrow R) \implies P \rightarrow R" />
</MathContainer>

The question states that **it is currently the rainy season** (<InlineMath math="P" /> occurs).

Therefore, based on the logic above, the inevitable conclusion is **residents are forced to evacuate to a safe place** (<InlineMath math="R" />).

> Residents will be forced to evacuate to a safe place.
