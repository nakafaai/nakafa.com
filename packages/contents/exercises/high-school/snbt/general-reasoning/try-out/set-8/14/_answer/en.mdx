To determine the impact of the survey results on statements A and B, we need to analyze the core of each statement first.

Statement A links the habit of performing tasks routinely with student achievement. Meanwhile, Statement B links obtaining the highest exam scores with student achievement.

The survey results show the fact that current high-achieving students are dominated by those who get high exam scores. This data indicates a positive correlation and direct alignment with the claim in Statement B. If the majority of high-achieving students are those with high exam scores, then the argument that high exam scores lead to achievement becomes proven or supported by the field data.

In contrast, the survey results do not provide information regarding the routine of performing tasks, so they do not directly strengthen or weaken Statement A.

Therefore, the survey data clearly strengthens statement B.
