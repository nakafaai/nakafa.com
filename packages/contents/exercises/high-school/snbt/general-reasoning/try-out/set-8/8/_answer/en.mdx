Let's dissect the information in the text to determine the truth of each statement.

#### Facts in the Text

Based on the reading, we derive two main cause-and-effect relationships:

1.  **Vitamin C** in pineapples <InlineMath math="\rightarrow" /> Improves immune system <InlineMath math="\rightarrow" /> Prevents infection (like flu).
2.  **Bromelain Enzyme** in pineapples <InlineMath math="\rightarrow" /> Consumed by ulcer sufferers <InlineMath math="\rightarrow" /> Triggers ulcer symptoms (nausea and bloating).

#### Statement Analysis

We are asked to find the statement that is **DEFINITELY FALSE**. Let's examine the claim regarding the cause of ulcer symptoms:

*   The statement that **"The Vitamin C content in pineapples can trigger ulcer symptoms like nausea and bloating"** directly contradicts the text. The text specifically states that the substance triggering those symptoms is the **bromelain enzyme**, not Vitamin C.
*   Other statements, such as the benefits of preventing infection or the adverse effects of bromelain for ulcer sufferers, are consistent with the provided information.

Therefore, blaming Vitamin C as the cause of ulcer symptoms is an erroneous conclusion and is definitely false based on the text.

> In general reasoning questions, pay close attention to the subject (cause) of an effect. Swapping the cause (Vitamin C instead of Bromelain) makes the statement invalid.
