We can map the information into logic as follows:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Work Hard} \rightarrow \text{Chance of High Salary}" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Work Hard} \rightarrow \text{Chance of Promotion}" />
</MathContainer>

Both conditions (Chance of High Salary and Chance of Promotion) have the same trigger or prerequisite, which is **Working Hard**.

Since the group "Employees who work hard" must have both chances simultaneously, it can be concluded that employees who fall into the "Chance of High Salary" category (because they work hard) also automatically fall into the "Chance of Promotion" category.

Therefore, the correct conclusion is **"Employees who have a chance of getting a high salary are those who have a chance of getting a promotion."**

**Analysis of Other Options:**
- **Other options are incorrect** because they deny the relationship between the two chances (saying "not" or "do not"), even though both go hand in hand for employees who work hard.
