We can break down the information from the text into the following points:
1.  **Poultry**: Reproduces by laying eggs.
2.  **Snakes**: Reproduces by laying eggs (even though they are not poultry).

From these two premises, it is clear that there is a **similarity** between snakes and poultry in terms of their reproduction method.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Poultry} \xrightarrow{\text{Reproduction}} \text{Laying Eggs}" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Snakes} \xrightarrow{\text{Reproduction}} \text{Laying Eggs}" />
</MathContainer>

Since both result in the same method, the valid conclusion is that snakes **have the same method of reproduction as poultry**.

**Analysis of Other Options:**

- **Has a method of reproduction that is not the same**: *False*. Both reproduce by laying eggs.
- **Has the same characteristics**: *False*. "Characteristics" is too broad (could be physical, habitat, etc.), while the similarity is only mentioned in the reproduction method.
- **Has the same eggs**: *False*. The text does not discuss the physical appearance of the eggs.
- **Has the same way of laying eggs**: *Less Precise*. The phrase used in the text is "method of reproduction", not the technical "way of laying eggs" (the process). Option C is more precise according to the text.
