Let's analyze the premises given in the text:
1.  **Premise 1**: If the avocado is ready to harvest (<InlineMath math="P" />), then it tastes sweet and has a soft texture (<InlineMath math="Q" />).
2.  **Fact**: Andi's avocado is not sweet and not soft (<InlineMath math="\sim Q" />).

Based on **Modus Tollens** logic (<InlineMath math="P \rightarrow Q" />, and <InlineMath math="\sim Q" />, then <InlineMath math="\sim P" />), we can conclude with certainty that Andi's avocado is **not ready to harvest** (<InlineMath math="\sim P" />).

The conclusion proposed in the question states that "Andi's avocado is **ready to harvest**". This statement directly contradicts the valid logical result.

Therefore, the quality of the conclusion is **definitely false**.
