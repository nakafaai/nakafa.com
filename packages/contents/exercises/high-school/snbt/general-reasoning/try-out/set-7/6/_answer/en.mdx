We can analyze this problem using simple comparative logic.

Let's break down the given information:
1.  **Fact**: The terrace light is **brighter** than the bathroom light.
2.  **Rule**: Lights that are **brighter** <InlineMath math="\rightarrow" /> **more durable** AND **more expensive**.

Based on this rule, since the terrace light has the "brighter" property, it automatically possesses the "more durable" and "more expensive" properties compared to the bathroom light.

If we look at it from the opposite side (the bathroom light), since the bathroom light is less bright, then it is:
-   **Not more durable** than the terrace light.
-   **Not more expensive** than the terrace light.

In other words, the quality and price of the bathroom light are below or equal to the terrace light, which corresponds to the statement "not more durable and not more expensive".
