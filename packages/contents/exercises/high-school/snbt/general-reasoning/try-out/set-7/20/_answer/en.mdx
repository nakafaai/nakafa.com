Let's break down the logic of the statements using mathematical symbols to make the structure clearer.

Suppose we define the following three statements:
- <InlineMath math="P" />: Routinely jogs in the morning and has a good diet.
- <InlineMath math="Q" />: Has a strong physique.
- <InlineMath math="R" />: Healthier body.

Based on the question text, we get the following logical premises:

**Premise 1**: Someone will have a strong physique if they routinely jog in the morning and have a good diet.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P \rightarrow Q" />
</MathContainer>

**Premise 2**: A strong physique makes the body healthier.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="Q \rightarrow R" />
</MathContainer>

**Fact**: Andi routinely jogs in the morning and has a good diet.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Andi} = P" />
</MathContainer>

**Conclusion Analysis**

We can combine Premise 1 and Premise 2 using the **Hypothetical Syllogism** principle:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="(P \rightarrow Q) \land (Q \rightarrow R) \Rightarrow (P \rightarrow R)" />
</MathContainer>

This means: **"If someone routinely jogs in the morning and has a good diet, then their body will be healthier."**

Since Andi satisfies condition <InlineMath math="P" /> (routinely jogs and eats well), he automatically satisfies condition <InlineMath math="R" /> (has a healthy body).

Therefore, the conclusion that "Andi has a healthy body" is **valid** and **definitely true** based on deductive logic.
