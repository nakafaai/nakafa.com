Not brushing teeth regularly every day will cause food debris to remain in the mouth. Bacteria will grow on these debris, then release unpleasant-smelling compounds that cause bad breath. If left unchecked, the bad breath-causing bacteria will multiply more and more, eventually forming dental plaque. When that happens, the resulting odor can be more severe.

Based on the passage, what is the correct conclusion if dental plaque is not formed?
