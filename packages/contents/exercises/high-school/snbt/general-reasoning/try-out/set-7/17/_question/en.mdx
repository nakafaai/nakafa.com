Sleeping on the back (supine position) is a good sleeping position for most people. Someone who routinely sleeps on their back will not experience extra pressure on the front part of the body so they will not experience pain in that part. In addition, sleeping on the back can also prevent acid reflux disease. Sleeping on the back is not recommended for people who have a habit of snoring during sleep and sufferers of *sleep apnea*.

Based on the passage, which conclusion is appropriate if someone routinely sleeps on their back?
