Based on the text, there is a clear cause-and-effect relationship regarding the impact of IKN construction on animals:

> IKN Construction <InlineMath math="\rightarrow" /> Human-animal conflict <InlineMath math="\rightarrow" /> Threatens habitat <InlineMath math="\rightarrow" /> Some animals threatened with extinction.

This sequence of events demonstrates that the construction of IKN **has a real impact** on the existence and survival of animals in the region.

Therefore, the statement **"The construction of the National Capital City (IKN) does not affect the existence of animals"** is **DEFINITELY FALSE** because it explicitly contradicts the fact that the construction triggers conflicts and extinction threats.

**Analysis of Other Options:**

- **Minimizing habitat destruction can reduce extinction threats**: *True*. This is the solution proposed at the end of the text.
- **Some plant species are threatened with extinction**: *Inconclusive*. The text mentions "hundreds of plant species" exist there, but specifically states that "a number of animals" are threatened.
- **Some animals are threatened due to habitat destruction**: *True*. Conflicts threaten habitats, leading to extinction threats.
- **Habitat destruction affects construction**: *False*. The text's logic is that construction affects habitats, not the other way around.
