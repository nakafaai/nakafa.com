We can construct an implication logic based on the information in the text as follows:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P \rightarrow Q \rightarrow R" />
</MathContainer>

Where:
- <InlineMath math="P" />: Someone routinely sleeps on their back.
- <InlineMath math="Q" />: Does not experience extra pressure on the front part of the body.
- <InlineMath math="R" />: Does not experience pain in that part (front part of the body).

If someone routinely sleeps on their back (<InlineMath math="P" />), then based on the logic chain above, the conclusion is that they will not experience pain in the front part of the body (<InlineMath math="R" />).

Therefore, the appropriate conclusion is **"The front part of the body will not feel pain"**.

**Analysis of Other Options:**

- **The front part of the body will feel pain**: Contradicts conclusion <InlineMath math="R" />.
- **Potential to get acid reflux**: Incorrect, the text states it actually *prevents* acid reflux.
- **The neck will be free from pain**: Not discussed in the text (only discusses the front part of the body).
- **Snoring will decrease**: Incorrect, the text implies this position is not recommended for snorers (likely worsens it).
