To draw a valid conclusion from the text, we need to identify the explicitly stated cause-and-effect relationships. Let's define the key statements:

- <InlineMath math="P" />: Without proper supervision (parents do not provide proper supervision).
- <InlineMath math="Q" />: Mobile phones will have a negative impact on child development.
- <InlineMath math="R" />: Disruption of the child's brain growth (specific consequence of the negative impact).

Based on the text, the logical flow is sequential: "Without proper supervision (<InlineMath math="P" />), mobile phones will have a negative impact (<InlineMath math="Q" />), especially disrupting the child's brain growth (<InlineMath math="R" />)."

Mathematically, this can be written as a chain implication:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P \rightarrow Q \rightarrow R" />
</MathContainer>

The question asks for the conclusion if condition <InlineMath math="P" /> occurs ("if parents do not provide proper supervision"). Using the **Modus Ponens** rule (or direct inference on the implication chain), if the initial cause (<InlineMath math="P" />) happens, then the final effect (<InlineMath math="R" />) must occur.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{aligned} &P \rightarrow R \\ &P \\ \hline &\therefore R \end{aligned}" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the conclusion is <InlineMath math="R" />, which is **"Mobile phones will cause disruption to the child's brain growth"**.
