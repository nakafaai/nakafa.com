This problem can be solved using the concept of direct proportion between the height of an object and the length of its shadow. Let <InlineMath math="h_M" /> be Mirza's height.

Given:
- Nafis's height = <InlineMath math="1.5" /> meters
- Nafis's shadow = <InlineMath math="4.5" /> meters
- Mirza's shadow = <InlineMath math="6" /> meters

We set up the proportion equation:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\frac{\text{Mirza's Height}}{\text{Nafis's Height}} = \frac{\text{Mirza's Shadow}}{\text{Nafis's Shadow}}" />
  <BlockMath math="\frac{h_M}{1.5} = \frac{6}{4.5}" />
  <BlockMath math="h_M = \frac{6 \times 1.5}{4.5}" />
  <BlockMath math="h_M = \frac{9}{4.5}" />
  <BlockMath math="h_M = 2" />
</MathContainer>

So, Mirza's height is **<InlineMath math="2.00" /> meters**.
