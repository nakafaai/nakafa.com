Let's analyze the premises provided in the problem using mathematical logic:

- <InlineMath math="P" />: Budi diligently practices cycling.
- <InlineMath math="Q" />: Budi can cycle for long distances.
- <InlineMath math="R" />: Budi can win a bicycle race.

The given statements are:
1. If <InlineMath math="P" />, then <InlineMath math="Q" /> (<InlineMath math="P \rightarrow Q" />).
2. If <InlineMath math="Q" />, then <InlineMath math="R" /> (<InlineMath math="Q \rightarrow R" />).
3. Fact: Today Budi **cannot** cycle for long distances (<InlineMath math="\sim Q" />).

To draw a conclusion, we focus on the relationship between the first premise (<InlineMath math="P \rightarrow Q" />) and the existing fact (<InlineMath math="\sim Q" />). We can use the **Modus Tollens** rule:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{aligned} &P \rightarrow Q \\ &\sim Q \\ \hline &\therefore \sim P \end{aligned}" />
</MathContainer>

The conclusion is <InlineMath math="\sim P" /> (the negation of <InlineMath math="P" />). Since <InlineMath math="P" /> is "Budi diligently practices cycling", then <InlineMath math="\sim P" /> is **"Budi does not diligently practice cycling"**.

> Although one might argue for <InlineMath math="\sim R" /> (Budi cannot win) if <InlineMath math="\sim Q" /> were an absolute condition, in formal logic, Modus Tollens on the first premise provides the most direct and certain conclusion regarding the cause.
