To calculate the total visitors to the laboratory facility over the <InlineMath math="5" /> days, we need to sum up the laboratory visitor data (orange line) from Monday to Friday:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Monday} = 250" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Tuesday} = 210" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Wednesday} = 140" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Thursday} = 170" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Friday} = 120" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the total number of visitors is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = 250 + 210 + 140 + 170 + 120" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = 860 \text{ people}" />
</MathContainer>

So, the total number of visitors to the laboratory facility over the <InlineMath math="5" /> days is **<InlineMath math="860" /> people**.
