To determine which statement is **DEFINITELY TRUE**, we must carefully match each option with the information in the text.

#### Analysis of the Correct Statement

The text explicitly states:

> "The fiber and water content in apples will provide a sensation of fullness for longer."

We can structure this as an implication:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P \rightarrow Q" />
</MathContainer>

Where:
- <InlineMath math="P" />: Fiber and water content in apples.
- <InlineMath math="Q" />: Provides a sensation of fullness for longer.

The statement "A longer sensation of fullness can be obtained from apple consumption due to the fiber and water content in it" is **fully supported** by the text (equivalent to the implication).

#### Analysis of Other Statements

Why other options are incorrect:

- **Potential to cause obesity**: Contradictory. The text states apples prevent habits leading to obesity.
- **Reducing someone**: Awkward phrasing. The text says apples reduce the "desire" for sweets, not the person.
- **High sugar levels make you full**: Not in text. Satiety is attributed to "fiber and water", not sweetness/sugar.
- **Highest content**: Unfounded. The text mentions vitamins/minerals but never claims they are the "highest" compared to other fruits.

Thus, the only definitely true statement is the one linking fiber, water, and fullness.
