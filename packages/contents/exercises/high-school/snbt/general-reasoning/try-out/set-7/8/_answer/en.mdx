To assess the quality of the conclusion, we must strictly compare it with the available information:

1.  **Information**: Changes in green land cover <InlineMath math="\rightarrow" /> Increased land surface temperature AND Increased air pollution.
2.  **Fact**: City A is experiencing changes in green land cover.
3.  **Proposed Conclusion**: Potentially causes **flooding**.

In formal logic for scholastic aptitude tests, we are only allowed to draw conclusions from the provided premises. The text does not mention any relationship between "green land cover" and "flooding" at all. Although this might be related in the real world, in the context of the provided information, the variable "flooding" is absent.

Therefore, the conclusion regarding flooding is considered **irrelevant** to the premises, which limit the impact only to "temperature" and "pollution".
