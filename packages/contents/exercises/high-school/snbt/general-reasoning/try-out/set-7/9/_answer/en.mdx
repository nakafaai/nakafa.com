To find the second highest number of visitors, we need to sum the total visitors of the library and laboratory for each day:

-   **Monday**: <InlineMath math="150 + 250 = 400" /> people.
-   **Tuesday**: <InlineMath math="135 + 210 = 345" /> people.
-   **Wednesday**: <InlineMath math="100 + 140 = 240" /> people.
-   **Thursday**: <InlineMath math="140 + 170 = 310" /> people.
-   **Friday**: <InlineMath math="165 + 120 = 285" /> people.

Now let's rank the number of visitors from highest to lowest:
1.  Monday (<InlineMath math="400" />)
2.  **Tuesday (<InlineMath math="345" />)**
3.  Thursday (<InlineMath math="310" />)
4.  Friday (<InlineMath math="285" />)
5.  Wednesday (<InlineMath math="240" />)

Therefore, the second highest number of visitors in the two facilities of SMA MMM occurred on **Tuesday**.
