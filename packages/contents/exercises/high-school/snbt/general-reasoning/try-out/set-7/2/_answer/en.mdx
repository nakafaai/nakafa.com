To answer this question, we need to find the statement that **contradicts** or uses logic that is **too strong** (such as excessive generalization) compared to the information in the text.

#### Analysis of the Most Likely False Statement

Consider the following statement:

> "Pain and swelling in the gums are **always** caused by accumulated food leftovers."

The text explains the cause-and-effect flow as follows:
1. Food leftovers *can* accumulate.
2. This accumulation *can* harden into tartar.
3. Tartar *can* cause gums to become painful and swollen.

Notice the use of the words **"can"** and **"may"** which indicate *possibility*, not *absolute certainty*. The statement above uses the word **"always"**, which is an absolute claim. The text never states that food leftovers are the *only* cause of gum pain. Therefore, this claim is the most likely to be false because it over-generalizes.

#### Analysis of Other Statements

Let's see why the other statements tend to be **true** or consistent with the text:

- **"Teeth that are not routinely cleaned can form tartar"**

  The text explicitly states: *"If not cleaned routinely... can form tartar."*

- **"Accumulated tartar can cause gingivitis"**

  The text links tartar with pain/swelling, which are referred to as *"early symptoms of gum infection or gingivitis."*

- **"Food leftovers accumulating on the tooth surface have the potential to form tartar"**

  This is consistent with the sentence: *"these accumulated food leftovers can harden and form tartar."*

- **"Gum infection occurs due to the accumulation of tartar"**

  The text explains the flow from tartar accumulation to gum infection symptoms (pain and swelling).

In conclusion, the statement using the word **"always"** is the one least supported by the probabilistic nature of the text.
