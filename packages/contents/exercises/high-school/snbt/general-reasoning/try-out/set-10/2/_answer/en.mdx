To find the division with the highest acceptance percentage, we need to compare the number of **Accepted** candidates to the **Total Applicants** (Accepted + Rejected) in each division. The formula used is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Percentage} = \frac{\text{Accepted}}{\text{Accepted} + \text{Rejected}} \times 100\%" />
</MathContainer>

Let's calculate the acceptance percentage for each division sequentially.

**Division A** has <InlineMath math="30" /> accepted candidates out of a total of <InlineMath math="20 + 30 = 50" /> applicants.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\frac{30}{50} \times 100\% = 60\%" />
</MathContainer>

**Division B** has <InlineMath math="20" /> accepted candidates out of a total of <InlineMath math="30 + 20 = 50" /> applicants.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\frac{20}{50} \times 100\% = 40\%" />
</MathContainer>

**Division C** has <InlineMath math="50" /> accepted candidates out of a total of <InlineMath math="10 + 50 = 60" /> applicants.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\frac{50}{60} \times 100\% = 83.33\%" />
</MathContainer>

**Division D** has <InlineMath math="90" /> accepted candidates out of a total of <InlineMath math="30 + 90 = 120" /> applicants.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\frac{90}{120} \times 100\% = 75\%" />
</MathContainer>

**Division E** has <InlineMath math="50" /> accepted candidates out of a total of <InlineMath math="25 + 50 = 75" /> applicants.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\frac{50}{75} \times 100\% = 66.66\%" />
</MathContainer>

Based on the calculations above, it is clear that **Division C** has the highest acceptance percentage, which is <InlineMath math="83.33\%" />.
