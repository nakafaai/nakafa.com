To answer this question, we need to compare each statement in the options with the core information presented in the text. The text explicitly states two main mechanisms by which grapes affect blood pressure:

1.  High antioxidant content helps **lower** high blood pressure.
2.  High potassium content helps eliminate the effects of sodium, so high blood pressure can be **reduced**.

The main conclusion is that consuming grapes has a positive impact on lowering blood pressure.

Now let's examine the statement: **"The more grapes consumed, the higher the blood pressure will be."**

This statement clearly **contradicts** the information in the passage. The text states that grapes function to *lower* or *reduce* high blood pressure, not raise it. Therefore, the claim that grape consumption will make blood pressure higher is false, and this is the answer we are looking for because the question asks for the statement that is **NOT TRUE**.

The other statements align with the text as they all support the idea that grapes are beneficial for lowering blood pressure or eliminating the effects of sodium.
