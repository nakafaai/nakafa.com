To determine the division with the highest number of applicants, we must sum the **Accepted** and **Rejected** candidates for each division. Let's calculate them one by one.

**Division A** has <InlineMath math="20" /> rejected candidates and <InlineMath math="30" /> accepted candidates. The total number of applicants is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="20 + 30 = 50" />
</MathContainer>

**Division B** has <InlineMath math="30" /> rejected candidates and <InlineMath math="20" /> accepted candidates. The total number of applicants is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="30 + 20 = 50" />
</MathContainer>

**Division C** has <InlineMath math="10" /> rejected candidates and <InlineMath math="50" /> accepted candidates. The total number of applicants is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="10 + 50 = 60" />
</MathContainer>

**Division D** has <InlineMath math="30" /> rejected candidates and <InlineMath math="90" /> accepted candidates. The total number of applicants is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="30 + 90 = 120" />
</MathContainer>

**Division E** has <InlineMath math="25" /> rejected candidates and <InlineMath math="50" /> accepted candidates. The total number of applicants is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="25 + 50 = 75" />
</MathContainer>

Based on these calculations, it is clear that **Division D** has the highest number of applicants, which is <InlineMath math="120" /> people.
