We can dissect this logic using the principle of implication. Let **Likes Basketball** be <InlineMath math="P" /> and **Likes Mathematics** be <InlineMath math="Q" />. The statement "everyone who likes basketball definitely likes mathematics" can be written as <InlineMath math="P \rightarrow Q" />.

Andi is known to like mathematics (<InlineMath math="Q" />). In mathematical logic, if the consequent (<InlineMath math="Q" />) occurs, we **cannot guarantee** that the antecedent (<InlineMath math="P" />) is the cause. Andi might like mathematics for other reasons, not necessarily because he likes basketball.

However, there is no information prohibiting Andi from liking basketball. Therefore, the conclusion that "Andi likes basketball" has a chance of being true, but it cannot be confirmed with <InlineMath math="100\%" /> certainty. Thus, the quality of the conclusion is **possibly true**.
