To determine which class has the highest percentage of students who like mathematics, we use the same proportion formula as in the previous question, comparing the number of students who like the subject to the total number of students in that class.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Percentage} = \frac{\text{Like}}{\text{Like} + \text{Dislike}} \times 100\%" />
</MathContainer>

Here are the percentage calculation results for each class:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{MMM} = \frac{23}{63} \approx 36.5\%" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{NNN} = \frac{18}{38} \approx 47.3\%" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{PPP} = \frac{10}{25} = 40.0\%" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{QQQ} = \frac{17}{40} = 42.5\%" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{RRR} = \frac{21}{56} = 37.5\%" />
</MathContainer>

Based on the comparison above, class <InlineMath math="\text{NNN}" /> has the highest percentage at <InlineMath math="47.3\%" />. This indicates that the proportion of students who like mathematics in that class is greater than in the other classes.
