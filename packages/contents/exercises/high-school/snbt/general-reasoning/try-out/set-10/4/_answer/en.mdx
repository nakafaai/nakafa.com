Our focus is to find the amount of bread obtained by **Team D**. Let's analyze the available information to determine what is relevant.

Information <InlineMath math="(3)" /> states that Team D gets one-third of the **total bread**. However, this information alone is insufficient because we do not yet know the total amount of bread distributed.

Information <InlineMath math="(4)" /> provides data that one box contains <InlineMath math="20" /> packs. Since Andi distributes **three boxes**, we can calculate the total bread:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Bread} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ packs}" />
</MathContainer>

After knowing the total bread from information <InlineMath math="(4)" />, we can go back to using information <InlineMath math="(3)" /> to calculate Team D's share:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Team D's Bread} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \text{ packs}" />
</MathContainer>

Information <InlineMath math="(1)" /> and <InlineMath math="(2)" /> discuss the distribution for Teams A, B, and C. This data is **not needed** as it does not affect the calculation of Team D's share, which is based directly on the total bread.

Therefore, we only need information <InlineMath math="(3)" /> and <InlineMath math="(4)" /> to solve this problem.
