To determine which class has the lowest percentage of students who like mathematics, we need to compare the proportion of students who like the subject to the total number of students in each class. The total number of students is calculated by adding those who like and dislike the subject.

The formula used is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Percentage} = \frac{\text{Like}}{\text{Like} + \text{Dislike}} \times 100\%" />
</MathContainer>

Here is the detailed percentage calculation for each class:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{MMM} = \frac{23}{23+40} \times 100\% = \frac{23}{63} \approx 36.5\%" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{NNN} = \frac{18}{18+20} \times 100\% = \frac{18}{38} \approx 47.3\%" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{PPP} = \frac{10}{10+15} \times 100\% = \frac{10}{25} = 40.0\%" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{QQQ} = \frac{17}{17+23} \times 100\% = \frac{17}{40} = 42.5\%" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{RRR} = \frac{21}{21+35} \times 100\% = \frac{21}{56} = 37.5\%" />
</MathContainer>

From the calculation results above, we can compare the percentage values of each class.

It is clear that class <InlineMath math="\text{MMM}" /> has the smallest percentage, which is approximately <InlineMath math="36.5\%" />, lower than class <InlineMath math="\text{RRR}" /> (<InlineMath math="37.5\%" />) and the other classes.
