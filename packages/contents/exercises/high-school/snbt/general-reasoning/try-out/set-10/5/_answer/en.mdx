To determine the amount of bread obtained by **Team A**, we must relate all variables to the total bread availability.

The first step is to find the **Total Bread** distributed. Information <InlineMath math="(4)" /> states that one box contains <InlineMath math="20" /> packs. Since there are <InlineMath math="3" /> boxes, we can calculate the total:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Bread} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ packs}" />
</MathContainer>

Next, we need to separate Team D's share to find the remaining bread for Teams A, B, and C. Information <InlineMath math="(3)" /> mentions Team D gets one-third of the total.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Team D's Bread} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \text{ packs}" />
</MathContainer>

The remaining bread for Teams A, B, and C is <InlineMath math="60 - 20 = 40" /> packs. Now we need their distribution ratios:
- Information <InlineMath math="(1)" /> states <InlineMath math="A = \frac{1}{2}B" /> or <InlineMath math="B = 2A" />.
- Information <InlineMath math="(2)" /> states <InlineMath math="B = C" />, so <InlineMath math="C = 2A" />.

By substituting these relationships into the remaining bread equation <InlineMath math="A + B + C = 40" />, we get:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="A + 2A + 2A = 40" />
  <BlockMath math="5A = 40" />
  <BlockMath math="A = 8 \text{ packs}" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, we need **all information** <InlineMath math="(1)" />, <InlineMath math="(2)" />, <InlineMath math="(3)" />, and <InlineMath math="(4)" /> to determine the amount of bread Team A obtained.
