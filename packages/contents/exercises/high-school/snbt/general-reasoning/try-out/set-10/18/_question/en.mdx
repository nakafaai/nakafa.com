The number of visitors to store A for seven consecutive days is <InlineMath math="30, 33, 35, 36, 39, 41," /> and <InlineMath math="42" /> people. Meanwhile, the number of visitors to store B during the same seven days is <InlineMath math="7, 10, 17, 27, 44, 71," /> and <InlineMath math="115" /> people.
