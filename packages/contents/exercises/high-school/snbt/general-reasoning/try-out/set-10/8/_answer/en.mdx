This question tests the ability to draw logical conclusions (syllogism). We can break down the sentences in the text into symbolic logical premises. Let's define three basic statements:

- <InlineMath math="P" />: It is currently the dry season.
- <InlineMath math="Q" />: Plants shed their leaves.
- <InlineMath math="R" />: There is a lot of scattered leaf litter.

Based on the text, we derive two logical implications. The sentence "In the dry season, plants will shed their leaves" can be written as <InlineMath math="P \rightarrow Q" />. Furthermore, the sentence "when plants shed their leaves, there is a lot of scattered leaf litter" can be written as <InlineMath math="Q \rightarrow R" />.

Using the principle of **Hypothetical Syllogism**, we can draw a direct conclusion from <InlineMath math="P" /> to <InlineMath math="R" />:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{align*} \text{Premise 1} &: P \rightarrow Q \\ \text{Premise 2} &: Q \rightarrow R \\ \hline \therefore \text{Conclusion} &: P \rightarrow R \end{align*}" />
</MathContainer>

This means that if <InlineMath math="P" /> occurs, then <InlineMath math="R" /> must occur. In plain language: "If it is currently the dry season, then there is a lot of scattered leaf litter." Options containing "might be" are incorrect because this deductive logic yields certainty, not mere possibility.

Thus, the correct statement is **if it is currently the dry season, then there is a lot of scattered leaf litter**.
