To find the statement that is **NOT TRUE**, we must compare the claim in the options with the quantitative data presented in the text.

The text explicitly states that deforestation accounts for <InlineMath math="15\%" /> of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.

Now let's examine the statement: **"Deforestation contributes almost all of the world's greenhouse gas emissions."**

The phrase **"almost all"** implies a proportion close to <InlineMath math="100\%" /> (an absolute majority). Mathematically and linguistically, the figure of <InlineMath math="15\%" /> is very far from the definition of "almost all". This is a clear **data contradiction**.

Therefore, the claim is false and does not align with the passage. The other statements (regarding soil erosion, wildlife habitats, and the impact on communities) are all directly supported by sentences in the text.
