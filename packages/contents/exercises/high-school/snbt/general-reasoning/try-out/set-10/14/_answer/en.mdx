Let's dissect the logical flow of the provided information using premises.

We can map the information into three main variables:
- <InlineMath math="P" />: Rain intensity increases significantly (extreme rain).
- <InlineMath math="Q" />: Flooding occurs.
- <InlineMath math="R" />: Green vegetation appears (due to increased soil moisture).

Based on the text, the cause-and-effect relationships formed are:
1. Extreme rain causes flooding (<InlineMath math="P \rightarrow Q" />).
2. Flooding causes the appearance of green vegetation (<InlineMath math="Q \rightarrow R" />).

Using the principle of hypothetical syllogism, we can draw a conclusion from these two premises:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\begin{align*} \text{Premise 1} &: P \rightarrow Q \\ \text{Premise 2} &: Q \rightarrow R \\ \hline \therefore \text{Conclusion} &: P \rightarrow R \end{align*}" />
</MathContainer>

The conclusion drawn is "if extreme rain intensity increases significantly again (<InlineMath math="P" />), it will give rise to green vegetation (<InlineMath math="R" />)". This statement aligns with the logical deduction <InlineMath math="P \rightarrow R" />.

Therefore, the conclusion is logically **definitely true**.
