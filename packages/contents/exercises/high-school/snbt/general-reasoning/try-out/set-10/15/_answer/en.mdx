Let's analyze the logic of the text using the principle of implication.

The first statement provides a cause-and-effect rule: "A person can catch the flu if they inhale saliva droplets from a patient." We can simplify this to:

> If inhale droplets (<InlineMath math="P" />) <InlineMath math="\rightarrow" /> Catch the flu (<InlineMath math="Q" />).

The fact is that Nia accidentally inhaled cough droplets from a person with the flu. This means condition <InlineMath math="P" /> is met. Based on the logic rule of Modus Ponens, if condition <InlineMath math="P" /> occurs, then the consequence <InlineMath math="Q" /> (catching the flu) should occur.

However, the proposed conclusion states the opposite, namely "Nia **will not** catch the flu". This statement directly contradicts the valid deduction derived from the premises. Since the conclusion denies the logical consequence that should happen, the quality of the conclusion is **definitely false**.
