The first step is to calculate the total clothes Aryo will donate. It is known to be five dozen.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ clothes}" />
</MathContainer>

Next, we analyze the available information to find the number of clothes <InlineMath math="\text{D}" /> gets.

Based on **Statement** <InlineMath math="(3)" />, it is stated that <InlineMath math="\text{D}" /> gets one-fourth of the total clothes. Since we already know the total clothes from the initial problem description, we can directly calculate <InlineMath math="\text{D}" />'s share using this statement alone.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{D} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total}" />
  <BlockMath math="\text{D} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ clothes}" />
</MathContainer>

The other statements are not needed because Statement <InlineMath math="(3)" /> is sufficient to answer the question independently without the help of other statements.

Thus, the only information needed is **Statement** <InlineMath math="(3)" />.
