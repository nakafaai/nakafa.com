Let's analyze the logical relationship between the three statements in depth.

**Statement A** focuses on **land use**. The argument is that the ratio of green areas to built-up areas influences flood potential. This is a general principle regarding soil absorption capacity.

**Statement B** focuses on **meteorological factors**. The argument is that high rainfall intensity increases river discharge and triggers flooding. This is a general principle regarding the hydrological cycle.

The **Environmental Expert's Statement** provides a **specific cause** for the current flooding in City X: **infrastructure failure** (a damaged dam).

The cause presented by the expert (dam damage) is an independent factor. The fact that the dam is damaged neither proves the green area theory (A) true or false, nor does it prove the rainfall theory (B) true or false. Dam failure can occur in both green and built-up areas, and it can happen whether there is heavy rain or not.

Therefore, the environmental expert's statement introduces a distinct third variable that has no direct causal link to strengthen or weaken the general arguments of A or B.
