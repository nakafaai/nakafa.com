The most true statement is **The contribution of the household consumption sector to Indonesia's economic growth will not reach <InlineMath math="2.74" /> percent**.

Based on the text, household consumption growth of <InlineMath math="5.05" /> percent contributed <InlineMath math="2.74" /> percent to economic growth.

Logically, if household consumption growth **decreases** or **does not reach** <InlineMath math="5" /> percent (lower than <InlineMath math="5.05" /> percent), then its contribution to economic growth will also be **smaller** than <InlineMath math="2.74" /> percent.

> The relationship between sector growth and its contribution is directly proportional. If growth slows down, its contribution will decrease.
