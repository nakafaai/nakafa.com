The government is ready to make various breakthroughs to improve the Indonesian economy, including taking advantage of opportunities from the United States-China trade war. One of the urgent problems to be solved is the trade balance deficit and the current account deficit. Based on BPS data, Indonesia's trade balance in January—April 2019 had a deficit of <InlineMath math="2.564" /> billion US dollars. Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia data shows that the current account in the first quarter of 2019 had a deficit of <InlineMath math="6.966" /> billion US dollars. Regarding this effort, the government requested input from entrepreneurs as material for consideration in taking economic policies. "I want inputs that are more concrete, real, and can be quickly implemented so that they can provide a good economic effect for our country," said the head of state in front of entrepreneurs who are members of Apindo and Hippindo (Association of Indonesian Shopping Center Tenants). That is why good synergy is needed between the government and the business world to face economic challenges in the future.
