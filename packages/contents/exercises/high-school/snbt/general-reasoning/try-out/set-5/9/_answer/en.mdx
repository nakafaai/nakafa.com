Let's analyze the logic of the key statement in the text:

*"If consumption exceeds reasonable limits, the house electricity will automatically be cut off."*

We can break this statement down into two propositions:
*   <InlineMath math="p" />: Consumption exceeds reasonable limits.
*   <InlineMath math="q" />: House electricity will be cut off.

The logical implication form is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="p \rightarrow q" />
</MathContainer>

The question asks us to find the **wrong conclusion**. In mathematical logic, a statement that is false (contradictory) to an implication is its **negation**.

The formula for the negation of the implication <InlineMath math="p \rightarrow q" /> is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\sim(p \rightarrow q) \equiv p \land \sim q" />
</MathContainer>

Meaning: **Consumption exceeds reasonable limits AND house electricity is NOT cut off.**

This statement directly contradicts the premise provided in the text, making it the wrong conclusion.
