Let's break down this artificial language by examining its vocabulary and sentence structure. From the given information, we can identify the basic vocabulary: `beeppz!` means **cobra**, `!meeongw` is **kitten**, and `beeppzpz!` (with the extra -pz suffix) signifies **many cobras**.

Next, let's analyze the sentence `yum ybeeppz! ong!meeongw` which means **kitten eats cobra**. Notice that the verb `yum` (eats) comes at the beginning. The subject is kitten (`!meeongw`) marked with the prefix `ong-`, while the object is cobra (`beeppz!`) marked with the prefix `y-`.

Thus, the sentence pattern in this language can be formulated as follows:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{yum} + y\text{-[Object]} + ong\text{-[Subject]}" />
</MathContainer>

We are asked to translate **many cobras eat kittens**. Here, the subject is **many cobras** (`beeppzpz!`) and the object is **kitten** (`!meeongw`). Let's construct the sentence following the pattern above:

1. Verb: `yum`
2. Object (kitten) with y- prefix: `y!meeongw`
3. Subject (many cobras) with ong- prefix: `ongbeeppzpz!`

So, the complete translation is **yum y!meeongw ongbeeppzpz!**.
