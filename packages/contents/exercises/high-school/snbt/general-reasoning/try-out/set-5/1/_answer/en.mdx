To determine the argument that weakens the statement, we need to understand the core issue presented in the text.

**Text Analysis:**
1.  **Fact:** Egg demand increased by <InlineMath math="10\%" />.
2.  **Fact:** Egg prices rose from Rp <InlineMath math="26,300" /> to Rp <InlineMath math="27,050" />.
3.  **Cause:** Disrupted distribution (COVID-19) and potential influence from upstream production (low production).

The text builds an argument that the price increase is caused by high demand and supply constraints (distribution/production). An argument that weakens this must be a fact or statement that contradicts this cause-and-effect logic, particularly on the supply side.

Let's analyze each option:

| Option | Analysis | Conclusion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The community chooses to consume purebred chicken eggs** | This actually **supports** the fact of increased demand. If more people choose eggs, demand rises, and price increases are expected. | Incorrect |
| **The price of chicken eggs keeps rising** | This is a **repetition of facts** in the text, not an argument that weakens it. | Incorrect |
| **Distribution is disrupted** | This is a **cause** mentioned in the text. Agreeing with this cause strengthens the statement. | Incorrect |
| **Egg production is minimal while demand is increasing** | This is the **core argument** of the text (economic law: low supply + high demand = high price). This strengthens the statement. | Incorrect |
| **The number of chicken farmers is increasing** | If the number of farmers increases, logically **production capacity increases**. If production increases (high supply), prices should tend to fall or stabilize, contradicting the claim that upstream production issues are causing the price hike. | **Correct** |

Therefore, the statement that "The number of chicken farmers is increasing" weakens the suspicion that production issues are the cause of the price increase, or weakens the trend of rising prices itself due to potentially increased supply.

Thus, the argument that weakens the statement is **the number of chicken farmers is increasing**.
