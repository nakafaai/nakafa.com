The given premise has a disjunctive logic structure:
1.  **P:** Employees resign with severance pay.
2.  **Q:** The company is closed.

The statement asserts: **P or Q**.

The fact is **Q** (the company is closed). In the context of this logic (exclusive disjunctive syllogism commonly found in general reasoning tests), if one option occurs, the other does not. Since the company is closed, the event of employees resigning with severance pay did not occur.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the company does not give severance pay to employees.
