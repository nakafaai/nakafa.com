There are <InlineMath math="3" /> vehicles, namely vehicles <InlineMath math="X" />, <InlineMath math="Y" />, and <InlineMath math="Z" />. The speed of vehicle <InlineMath math="X" /> is twice that of vehicle <InlineMath math="Y" />. Meanwhile, the speed of vehicle <InlineMath math="Z" /> is twice that of vehicle <InlineMath math="X" />. If the distance traveled by vehicle <InlineMath math="Z" /> in <InlineMath math="2" /> hours is <InlineMath math="40" /> km, then in <InlineMath math="3" /> hours vehicle <InlineMath math="Y" /> can travel a distance of ... km.
