Let's map the nutritional content of each fruit into a simple table:

| Fruit | Water | Fat | Carbohydrates |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Avocado** | High | High | Low |
| **Banana** | Low | Low | High |
| **Papaya** | **High** | **None** | **Low** |

The question asks for the **incorrect** possibility if a child eats a **Papaya**.

Based on the table above, if a child eats a papaya, they will get:
1.  High water content.
2.  Low carbohydrates.
3.  **No fat at all**.

Therefore, the statement that "Some children get fat" is **definitely false** or impossible, because papayas contain no fat. Other statements might still be possible or relevant to papaya's content, but the claim of getting fat clearly contradicts the nutritional facts of papaya.
