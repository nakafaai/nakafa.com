Let's break down the logic premises into a document ownership table:

| Citizen Group | Has Birth Certificate? | Has ID Card (KTP)? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **WNI (General)** | **Yes** (All) | Depends on Age |
| **WNI <InlineMath math="> 17" /> Years** | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| **WNI <InlineMath math="< 17" /> Years** | **Yes** | No |

**Analysis of Jakarta Residents:**
1.  **Jakarta Residents are WNI**: Therefore, *all* Jakarta residents must have a **Birth Certificate**.
2.  **Age of Jakarta Residents**:
    *   Some are **<InlineMath math="< 17" /> years old** (only have a Birth Certificate).
    *   Some are **<InlineMath math="> 17" /> years old** (have a Birth Certificate **and** an ID Card).

Since there are Jakarta residents who are over <InlineMath math="17" /> years old (implied by "Some are under <InlineMath math="17" />", meaning the rest are over or equal to <InlineMath math="17" />), this group must possess both documents.

Therefore, the valid conclusion is that **some Jakarta residents have a birth certificate and ID card (KTP)**.
