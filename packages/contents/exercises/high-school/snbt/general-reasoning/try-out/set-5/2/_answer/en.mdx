To answer this question, we need to verify each option based on the data in the table. Remember, we are looking for the conclusion that is **NOT TRUE**.

**Analysis of Options:**

1.  **"The harvest area in 2018 was more than double the harvest area in 2016"**
    *   Harvest area 2016 = <InlineMath math="2,407" /> Ha.
    *   Double that amount = <InlineMath math="2 \times 2,407 = 4,814" /> Ha.
    *   Harvest area 2018 = <InlineMath math="5,013" /> Ha.
    *   Since <InlineMath math="5,013 > 4,814" />, this statement is **TRUE**.

2.  **"Garlic production in 2018 was double the garlic production in 2017"**
    *   Production 2017 = <InlineMath math="19,150" /> Tons.
    *   Double that amount = <InlineMath math="2 \times 19,150 = 38,300" /> Tons.
    *   Production 2018 = <InlineMath math="38,300" /> Tons.
    *   Since the values match exactly, this statement is **TRUE**.

3.  **"In the 2015–2017 period, the garlic harvest area decreased continuously"**
    *   2015: <InlineMath math="2,563" /> Ha.
    *   2016: <InlineMath math="2,407" /> Ha (Decreased).
    *   2017: <InlineMath math="2,146" /> Ha (Decreased again).
    *   There was a continuous decline, so this statement is **TRUE**.

4.  **"In 2017, there was a decrease in harvest area, production, and import of garlic"**
    *   Let's compare 2017 with the previous year (2016).
    *   **Harvest Area**: <InlineMath math="2,407 \rightarrow 2,146" /> (Decreased <InlineMath math="\checkmark" />).
    *   **Production**: <InlineMath math="21,150 \rightarrow 19,150" /> (Decreased <InlineMath math="\checkmark" />).
    *   **Import**: <InlineMath math="444,301 \rightarrow 556,060" /> (**INCREASED** <InlineMath math="\times" />).
    *   Since imports actually **increased**, the statement that all three decreased is **FALSE**.

5.  **"There was a continuous increase in the amount of garlic imports in the last two years"**
    *   The last two years in the table are 2017 and 2018 (comparing to previous years).
    *   2016 to 2017: <InlineMath math="444,301 \rightarrow 556,060" /> (Increased).
    *   2017 to 2018: <InlineMath math="556,060 \rightarrow 582,995" /> (Increased).
    *   The trend is continuously rising, so this statement is **TRUE**.

In conclusion, the only statement that contradicts the table data is the option stating that imports decreased in 2017.

Thus, the conclusion that is not true is **in 2017, there was a decrease in harvest area, production, and import of garlic**.
