To determine the number of possible password arrangements, we can break down the problem by analyzing the possibilities for each digit position separately.

#### Position Analysis

Each position has specific criteria limiting the characters that can be used. Here is the breakdown of possibilities for each position:

| Position | Condition | Valid Choices | Possibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **1st** | Letters forming "ZIVA" | Z, I, V, A | <InlineMath math="4" /> |
| **2nd** | Factors of <InlineMath math="9" /> | 1, 3, 9 | <InlineMath math="3" /> |
| **3rd** | Odd prime numbers (1 digit) | 3, 5, 7 | <InlineMath math="3" /> |
| **4th** | Members of set <InlineMath math="\{2, 3, 4\}" /> | 2, 3, 4 | <InlineMath math="3" /> |

#### Total Calculation

Based on the multiplication principle (counting slot rule), the total number of password arrangements is the product of the possibilities in each position.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total} = 4 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 108" />
</MathContainer>

So, there are <InlineMath math="108" /> possible password arrangements.
