The statement that is the most **incorrect** is **Although Indonesia's GDP growth plummeted to <InlineMath math="4.88" /> percent, Indonesia's economic condition remained within encouraging limits**.

The text states that in <InlineMath math="2015" />, economic growth reached its **lowest point** and **plummeted** below <InlineMath math="5" /> percent.

> The use of the words "lowest point" and "plummeted" has a strong negative connotation, which contradicts the claim that the condition "remained within encouraging limits".

#### Analysis of Other Options

*   **Option on 2016 Trend**: Matches the text ("In <InlineMath math="2016" />, economic conditions turned around...").
*   **Option on 2018 GDP**: Matches the text (GDP Rp<InlineMath math="14,837.4" /> trillion is close to Rp<InlineMath math="15" /> thousand trillion, GDP per capita Rp<InlineMath math="56" /> million).
*   **Option on 2015 Lowest Point**: Matches the text (lowest point, did not reach <InlineMath math="5" /> percent).
