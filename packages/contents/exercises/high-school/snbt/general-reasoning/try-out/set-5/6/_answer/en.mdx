Let's summarize the sales data (in hundred thousands) into a table for easier comparison:

| Company | Jan | Feb | Mar | Total |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **A** | <InlineMath math="27" /> | <InlineMath math="31.8" /> | <InlineMath math="26.9" /> | **<InlineMath math="85.7" />** |
| **B** | <InlineMath math="19.7" /> | <InlineMath math="23.2" /> | <InlineMath math="21.5" /> | **<InlineMath math="64.4" />** |
| **C** | <InlineMath math="11.8" /> | <InlineMath math="14.9" /> | <InlineMath math="17" /> | **<InlineMath math="43.7" />** |
| **D** | <InlineMath math="20.7" /> | <InlineMath math="10.8" /> | <InlineMath math="16.8" /> | **<InlineMath math="48.3" />** |

Based on the table above, we can conclude the following facts:

1.  **Total Sales**: It is clear that **Company C** has the lowest total sales (<InlineMath math="43.7" />), while Company A holds the highest (<InlineMath math="85.7" />).
2.  **Trend Patterns**: Almost all companies experienced fluctuations (ups and downs), *except* **Company C**, which consistently increased every month (<InlineMath math="11.8 \to 14.9 \to 17" />).
3.  **Spikes & Drops**: The most drastic changes were actually experienced by **Company D** (a sharp drop from Jan to Feb, followed by a sharp rise to Mar), not Company B.

Therefore, the most accurate statement based on the data is that **the lowest number of smartphone users is from Company C**.
