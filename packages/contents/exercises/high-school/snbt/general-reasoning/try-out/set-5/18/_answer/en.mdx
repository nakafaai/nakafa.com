The most appropriate statement is **During those six years, Indonesia's economic growth in <InlineMath math="2013" /> was always higher than in the following years**.

If we observe the graph, the year <InlineMath math="2013" /> has the highest bar with a value of <InlineMath math="5.58" /> percent. This value is never surpassed by the following years, which only range from <InlineMath math="4.88" /> to <InlineMath math="5.17" /> percent.

> **Graph Trend Analysis**
>
> The graph shows an imperfect "V" pattern:
> *   **Decreasing** from <InlineMath math="2013" /> to the lowest point in <InlineMath math="2015" /> (<InlineMath math="4.88" />%).
> *   **Increasing back** (improving) from <InlineMath math="2015" /> to <InlineMath math="2018" />.

This automatically invalidates the statements that the economy is "always declining" or "never declining". Furthermore, the decline difference from <InlineMath math="2014" /> to <InlineMath math="2015" /> (<InlineMath math="0.13" />%) is actually **smaller** than the increase in the following year (<InlineMath math="0.15" />%), so the other options are also incorrect.
