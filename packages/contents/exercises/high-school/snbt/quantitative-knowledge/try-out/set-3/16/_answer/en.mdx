Let's analyze each plane figure based on rotational symmetry and reflectional symmetry.

| Plane Figure | Rotational Symmetry | Reflectional Symmetry |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Regular octagon | <InlineMath math="8" /> | <InlineMath math="8" /> |
| Rhombus | <InlineMath math="2" /> | <InlineMath math="2" /> |
| Isosceles triangle not equilateral | <InlineMath math="1" /> | <InlineMath math="1" /> |
| Kite | <InlineMath math="1" /> | <InlineMath math="1" /> |

#### Explanation

##### Regular octagon

- Rotational symmetry <InlineMath math="8" /> (can be rotated at <InlineMath math="45^\circ, 90^\circ, 135^\circ, \ldots, 315^\circ" />).
- Reflectional symmetry <InlineMath math="8" /> (through diagonals and midlines).

##### Rhombus that is not a square

- Rotational symmetry <InlineMath math="2" /> (initial position and <InlineMath math="180^\circ" /> rotation).
- Reflectional symmetry <InlineMath math="2" /> (through both diagonals).

##### Isosceles triangle that is not equilateral

- Rotational symmetry <InlineMath math="1" /> (only initial position).
- Reflectional symmetry <InlineMath math="1" /> (through the height from the apex angle).

##### Kite that is not a square

- Rotational symmetry <InlineMath math="1" /> (only initial position).
- Reflectional symmetry <InlineMath math="1" /> (through one of the diagonals).

#### Conclusion

There are no figures that have more rotational symmetries than reflectional symmetries. All figures have the same number of rotational symmetries as reflectional symmetries or fewer.

Thus, the answer is <InlineMath math="0" />.
