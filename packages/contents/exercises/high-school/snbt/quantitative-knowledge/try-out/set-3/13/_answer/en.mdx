There are <InlineMath math="3" /> boxes available.
Two marbles will be placed into these boxes, with the condition that one box can only hold one marble.

Let the boxes be numbered 1, 2, 3 (from left to right).

**Sample space**

The total number of ways to choose 2 boxes from 3 available boxes:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="n(S) = C(3, 2) = \frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \frac{3 \times 2!}{2! \times 1!} = 3" />
</MathContainer>

Possible pairs of filled boxes:
-   Boxes {1, 2} - Adjacent
-   Boxes {2, 3} - Adjacent
-   Boxes {1, 3} - Not adjacent

**Desired event**

The event that marbles are not adjacent (<InlineMath math="A" />) occurs when the filled boxes are {1, 3}.

<BlockMath math="n(A) = 1" />

**Probability**

The probability that marbles are stored not adjacent to each other:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)} = \frac{1}{3}" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the probability that the marbles are stored not adjacent to each other is <InlineMath math="\frac{1}{3}" />.
