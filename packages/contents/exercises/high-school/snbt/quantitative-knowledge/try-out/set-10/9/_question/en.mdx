Suppose a contractor is going to build an apartment. The probability of a public protest occurring is <InlineMath math="0.7" />. If there is no protest, the probability that the construction finishes on time is <InlineMath math="0.8" />. If there is a protest, the probability that the construction finishes on time is <InlineMath math="0.4" />.

Determine the probability that the construction finishes on time!
