Let <InlineMath math="P(A)" /> be the probability that each person gets a prize, then:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P(A) = \frac{\text{number of prizes}}{\text{number of participants}}" />
  <BlockMath math="P(A) = \frac{20}{3000}" />
  <BlockMath math="P(A) = \frac{1}{150}" />
  <BlockMath math="P(A) \approx 0.0067" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the probability that a participant gets a prize is <InlineMath math="0.0067" />.
