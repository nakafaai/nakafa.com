We will check each number based on the two given conditions:

*   Condition 1: Divided by <InlineMath math="7" />, the remainder is <InlineMath math="3" />.
*   Condition 2: Divided by <InlineMath math="2" />, the remainder is <InlineMath math="1" /> (meaning it is an odd number).

#### Checking Number 1 (94)

*   **Divided by 7:** <InlineMath math="94 \div 7 = 13" /> remainder <InlineMath math="3" /> (Satisfies condition 1).
*   **Divided by 2:** <InlineMath math="94" /> is an even number, so <InlineMath math="94 \div 2" /> remainder <InlineMath math="0" /> (Does not satisfy condition 2).

Conclusion: Number 94 is **incorrect**.

#### Checking Number 2 (80)

*   **Divided by 7:** <InlineMath math="80 \div 7 = 11" /> remainder <InlineMath math="3" /> (Satisfies condition 1).
*   **Divided by 2:** <InlineMath math="80" /> is an even number, so <InlineMath math="80 \div 2" /> remainder <InlineMath math="0" /> (Does not satisfy condition 2).

Conclusion: Number 80 is **incorrect**.

#### Checking Number 3 (38)

*   **Divided by 7:** <InlineMath math="38 \div 7 = 5" /> remainder <InlineMath math="3" /> (Satisfies condition 1).
*   **Divided by 2:** <InlineMath math="38" /> is an even number, so <InlineMath math="38 \div 2" /> remainder <InlineMath math="0" /> (Does not satisfy condition 2).

Conclusion: Number 38 is **incorrect**.

#### Checking Number 4 (17)

*   **Divided by 7:** <InlineMath math="17 \div 7 = 2" /> remainder <InlineMath math="3" /> (Satisfies condition 1).
*   **Divided by 2:** <InlineMath math="17" /> is an odd number, so <InlineMath math="17 \div 2" /> remainder <InlineMath math="1" /> (Satisfies condition 2).

Conclusion: Number 17 is **correct**.

#### Final Conclusion

The question asks which numbers are **incorrect**. Based on the check above, the numbers that do not satisfy both conditions are numbers (1), (2), and (3).
