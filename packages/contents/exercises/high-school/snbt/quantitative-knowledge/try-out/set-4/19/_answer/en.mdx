Given:
*   Initial ratio of alcohol : water = <InlineMath math="4 : 3" />
*   Added <InlineMath math="5" /> liters of water
*   Final ratio of alcohol : water = <InlineMath math="4 : 5" />

#### Analyzing Ratio Changes

Since only water is added, the amount of alcohol remains constant.
Let's look at the alcohol ratio parts:
*   Initial: <InlineMath math="4" /> parts
*   Final: <InlineMath math="4" /> parts

Since the alcohol parts are already equal (<InlineMath math="4" />), we can directly compare the water parts.

#### Calculating Current Water Volume

Change in water parts:
*   Initial: <InlineMath math="3" /> parts
*   Final: <InlineMath math="5" /> parts
*   Difference: <InlineMath math="5 - 3 = 2" /> parts

This difference of <InlineMath math="2" /> parts corresponds to the addition of <InlineMath math="5" /> liters of water.

So, the value per part is:
<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\frac{5 \text{ liters}}{2 \text{ parts}} = 2.5 \text{ liters/part}" />
</MathContainer>

The current volume of water (<InlineMath math="5" /> parts) is:
<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="5 \times 2.5 \text{ liters} = 12.5 \text{ liters}" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the amount of water currently contained in the solution is <InlineMath math="12.5" /> liters.
