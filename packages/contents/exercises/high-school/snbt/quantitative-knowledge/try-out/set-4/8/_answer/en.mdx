Let's analyze each plane figure based on the number of its reflectional and rotational symmetries.

The required conditions are:

1.  Rotational symmetry <InlineMath math="\ge 2" />
2.  Reflectional symmetry <InlineMath math="\ge 3" />

#### Scalene Triangle

*   **Reflectional symmetry:** 0 (has no axis of symmetry).
*   **Rotational symmetry:** 1 (only returns to original position after 360-degree rotation).

**Conclusion:** Does not satisfy both conditions.

#### Parallelogram Not a Rhombus

*   **Reflectional symmetry:** 0 (has no axis of symmetry).
*   **Rotational symmetry:** 2 (rotational symmetry of order 2).

**Conclusion:** Satisfies the rotational symmetry condition, but **does not satisfy** the reflectional symmetry condition.

#### Ellipse

*   **Reflectional symmetry:** 2 (major and minor axes).
*   **Rotational symmetry:** 2 (rotational symmetry of order 2).

**Conclusion:** Satisfies the rotational symmetry condition, but **does not satisfy** the reflectional symmetry condition (only has 2, requires at least 3).

#### Regular Hexagon

*   **Reflectional symmetry:** 6 (has 6 axes of symmetry).
*   **Rotational symmetry:** 6 (rotational symmetry of order 6).

**Conclusion:** Satisfies both conditions (rotational symmetry <InlineMath math="6 \ge 2" /> and reflectional symmetry <InlineMath math="6 \ge 3" />).

#### Final Conclusion

Of the four plane figures, only **1 plane figure** satisfies the criteria, which is the Regular Hexagon.
