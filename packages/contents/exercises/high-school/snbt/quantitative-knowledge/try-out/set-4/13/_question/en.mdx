A password consists of <InlineMath math="2" /> vowels and <InlineMath math="2" /> digits with alternating order and starts with a digit.

The password formation follows these rules:

1.  The first digit is an odd number.
2.  The first letter is not the letter A.
3.  The second digit is chosen from <InlineMath math="2, 4, 6, 8" />.
4.  The second letter is the letter O.

How many passwords can be formed if letters and digits cannot be repeated?
