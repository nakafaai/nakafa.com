Given 4 numbers as follows:

1.  <InlineMath math="94" />
2.  <InlineMath math="80" />
3.  <InlineMath math="38" />
4.  <InlineMath math="17" />

If these numbers are divided by <InlineMath math="7" />, the remainder is <InlineMath math="3" />, and if divided by <InlineMath math="2" />, the remainder is <InlineMath math="1" />.
Among the four numbers, which ones are **incorrect**?
