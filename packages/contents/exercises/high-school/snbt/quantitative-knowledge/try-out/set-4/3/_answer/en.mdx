Let's analyze the project conditions before and after workers get sick.

**Initial Plan:**

The work is planned to be completed by <InlineMath math="12" /> people in <InlineMath math="16" /> days.
Total workload = <InlineMath math="12 \times 16 = 192" /> work units.

**After 4 Days:**

The work has been done for <InlineMath math="4" /> days by <InlineMath math="12" /> people.
Completed work = <InlineMath math="12 \times 4 = 48" /> units.
Remaining workload = <InlineMath math="192 - 48 = 144" /> units.

Also, the remaining normal time is <InlineMath math="16 - 4 = 12" /> days if done by <InlineMath math="12" /> people.

**Changed Condition:**

There are <InlineMath math="4" /> sick people, so the remaining workers are <InlineMath math="12 - 4 = 8" /> people.
We use inverse proportion to find the additional time (<InlineMath math="w" />) needed by <InlineMath math="8" /> people to complete the remaining work.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="12 \text{ people} \times 12 \text{ days} = 8 \text{ people} \times w \text{ days}" />
  <BlockMath math="144 = 8w" />
  <BlockMath math="w = \frac{144}{8}" />
  <BlockMath math="w = 18 \text{ days}" />
</MathContainer>

So, <InlineMath math="8" /> workers need <InlineMath math="18" /> more days to complete the remaining project.

The total project completion time is the time already elapsed plus the remaining time needed.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Total Time} = 4 \text{ days} + 18 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days}" />
</MathContainer>

So, the project can be completed in <InlineMath math="22" /> days.
