To determine the passing percentage, we must check two passing conditions for each student:
1. The Science score must be higher than the median Science score of all students.
2. The average exam score (Math + Science) divided by <InlineMath math="2" /> must be greater than <InlineMath math="85" />.

#### Determining the Median Science Score

The Science scores are: <InlineMath math="78, 82, 87, 85, 79, 88, 81, 80" />.

Sort the data from smallest to largest:
<InlineMath math="78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 85, 87, 88" />.

Since there are <InlineMath math="8" /> data points, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th data points:
<BlockMath math="\text{Median} = \frac{81 + 82}{2} = 81.5" />

Students who satisfy the first condition (Science Score <InlineMath math="> 81.5" />) are:
- Boni (<InlineMath math="82" />)
- Cindy (<InlineMath math="87" />)
- Dita (<InlineMath math="85" />)
- Fani (<InlineMath math="88" />)

The other students (Ayu, Erfan, Gilang, Herman) have Science scores below the median, so they automatically do not pass.

#### Checking the Average Score Condition

Now we check the second condition for students who passed the first condition:

1. **Boni:**
   <BlockMath math="\text{Average} = \frac{92 + 82}{2} = \frac{174}{2} = 87" />
   Since <InlineMath math="87 > 85" />, Boni **Passes**.

2. **Cindy:**
   <BlockMath math="\text{Average} = \frac{90 + 87}{2} = \frac{177}{2} = 88.5" />
   Since <InlineMath math="88.5 > 85" />, Cindy **Passes**.

3. **Dita:**
   <BlockMath math="\text{Average} = \frac{86 + 85}{2} = \frac{171}{2} = 85.5" />
   Since <InlineMath math="85.5 > 85" />, Dita **Passes**.

4. **Fani:**
   <BlockMath math="\text{Average} = \frac{88 + 88}{2} = \frac{176}{2} = 88" />
   Since <InlineMath math="88 > 85" />, Fani **Passes**.

So, there are <InlineMath math="4" /> students who pass out of a total of <InlineMath math="8" /> students.

#### Calculating Quantity <InlineMath math="P" />

<BlockMath math="P = \frac{4}{8} \times 100\% = 50\%" />

#### Comparing <InlineMath math="P" /> and <InlineMath math="Q" />

Given <InlineMath math="Q = 65\%" />.

Thus:
<BlockMath math="50\% < 65\% \Rightarrow P < Q \text{ or } Q > P" />
