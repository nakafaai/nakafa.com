Observe the curve below!

<Graph
  title="Parabola Graph"
  description={
    <span>
      A parabola intersecting the <InlineMath math="x" />-axis and the <InlineMath math="y" />-axis.
    </span>
  }
/>

The correct statements regarding the curve are

1. The intersection point of the curve with the <InlineMath math="x" />-axis is <InlineMath math="(4, 0)" />.
2. The intersection points of the curve with the <InlineMath math="y" />-axis are <InlineMath math="(0, -5)" /> and <InlineMath math="(0, 1)" />.
3. The axis of symmetry is <InlineMath math="y = -1" />.
4. The axis of symmetry is <InlineMath math="x = -3" />.
