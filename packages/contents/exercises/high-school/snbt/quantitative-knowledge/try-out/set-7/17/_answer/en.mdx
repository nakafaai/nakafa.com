We will check each number to see if it satisfies both conditions: divided by <InlineMath math="5" /> gives a remainder of <InlineMath math="3" /> AND divided by <InlineMath math="4" /> gives a remainder of <InlineMath math="2" />.

#### Analysis of Statement <InlineMath math="1" />

Number: <InlineMath math="18" />.

- Divided by <InlineMath math="5" />: <InlineMath math="18 = 3 \times 5 + 3" />. Remainder is <InlineMath math="3" />. (Satisfied)
- Divided by <InlineMath math="4" />: <InlineMath math="18 = 4 \times 4 + 2" />. Remainder is <InlineMath math="2" />. (Satisfied)

So, the number <InlineMath math="18" /> is correct.

#### Analysis of Statement <InlineMath math="2" />

Number: <InlineMath math="38" />.

- Divided by <InlineMath math="5" />: <InlineMath math="38 = 7 \times 5 + 3" />. Remainder is <InlineMath math="3" />. (Satisfied)
- Divided by <InlineMath math="4" />: <InlineMath math="38 = 9 \times 4 + 2" />. Remainder is <InlineMath math="2" />. (Satisfied)

So, the number <InlineMath math="38" /> is correct.

#### Analysis of Statement <InlineMath math="3" />

Number: <InlineMath math="58" />.

- Divided by <InlineMath math="5" />: <InlineMath math="58 = 11 \times 5 + 3" />. Remainder is <InlineMath math="3" />. (Satisfied)
- Divided by <InlineMath math="4" />: <InlineMath math="58 = 14 \times 4 + 2" />. Remainder is <InlineMath math="2" />. (Satisfied)

So, the number <InlineMath math="58" /> is correct.

#### Analysis of Statement <InlineMath math="4" />

Number: <InlineMath math="78" />.

- Divided by <InlineMath math="5" />: <InlineMath math="78 = 15 \times 5 + 3" />. Remainder is <InlineMath math="3" />. (Satisfied)
- Divided by <InlineMath math="4" />: <InlineMath math="78 = 19 \times 4 + 2" />. Remainder is <InlineMath math="2" />. (Satisfied)

So, the number <InlineMath math="78" /> is correct.

In conclusion, all four numbers are correct.
