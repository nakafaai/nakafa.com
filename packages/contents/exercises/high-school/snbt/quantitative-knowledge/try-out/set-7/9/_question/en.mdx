A code consists of <InlineMath math="2" /> vowels and <InlineMath math="2" /> digits in an alternating sequence, starting with a letter. The formation of the code follows these rules:

1. The first letter is not <InlineMath math="A" />.
2. The first digit is an odd number.
3. The second letter is the letter <InlineMath math="O" />.
4. The second digit is chosen from <InlineMath math="0, 1, 2, 4, \text{ and } 6" />.

How many codes can be formed if no letters or digits can be repeated?
