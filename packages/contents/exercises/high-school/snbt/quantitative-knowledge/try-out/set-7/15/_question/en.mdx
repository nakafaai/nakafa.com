Joko's water tank can hold <InlineMath math="86" /> liters of water. Unfortunately, the tank is cracked, causing a leak of between <InlineMath math="0.3" /> liters and <InlineMath math="0.7" /> liters per hour. At <InlineMath math="07.00" /> AM, Joko filled his tank completely. Between <InlineMath math="07.00 - 11.00" />, there was no refilling or water usage. Which of the following relationships between quantities <InlineMath math="P" /> and <InlineMath math="Q" /> is correct based on the given information?

| <InlineMath math="P" /> | <InlineMath math="Q" /> |
| :---: | :--- |
| <InlineMath math="83.1" /> liters | Volume of water at <InlineMath math="11.00" /> |
