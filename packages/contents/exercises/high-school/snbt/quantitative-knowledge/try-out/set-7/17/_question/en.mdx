Given <InlineMath math="4" /> numbers as follows:
1. <InlineMath math="18" />
2. <InlineMath math="38" />
3. <InlineMath math="58" />
4. <InlineMath math="78" />

If these numbers are divided by <InlineMath math="5" />, the remainder is <InlineMath math="3" />, and if divided by <InlineMath math="4" />, the remainder is <InlineMath math="2" />. Among the four numbers, which one is correct?
