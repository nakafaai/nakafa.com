We will analyze each statement based on the given graph.

#### Analysis of Statement 1

Based on the graph, it is clear that the curve intersects the <InlineMath math="x" />-axis at the point <InlineMath math="(4, 0)" />.

Thus, statement <InlineMath math="(1)" /> is **correct**.

#### Analysis of Statement 2

Based on the graph, the curve intersects the <InlineMath math="y" />-axis at two points, namely at <InlineMath math="y = 3" /> and <InlineMath math="y = -5" />. So the intersection points are <InlineMath math="(0, 3)" /> and <InlineMath math="(0, -5)" />.

Statement <InlineMath math="(2)" /> states that the intersection points are <InlineMath math="(0, -5)" /> and <InlineMath math="(0, 1)" />. Since <InlineMath math="(0, 3) \neq (0, 1)" />, this statement does not match the graph.

Thus, statement <InlineMath math="(2)" /> is **incorrect**.

#### Analysis of Statement 3

The axis of symmetry for a horizontal parabola can be determined from the midpoint between the two <InlineMath math="y" />-intercepts (if known).

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="y_p = \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} = \frac{3 + (-5)}{2} = \frac{-2}{2} = -1" />
</MathContainer>

The axis of symmetry is obtained as the line <InlineMath math="y = -1" />.

Thus, statement <InlineMath math="(3)" /> is **correct**.

#### Analysis of Statement 4

Since the axis of symmetry is the horizontal line <InlineMath math="y = -1" />, the statement that the axis of symmetry is <InlineMath math="x = -3" /> (a vertical line) is clearly wrong.

Thus, statement <InlineMath math="(4)" /> is **incorrect**.

#### Conclusion

The correct statements are statements <InlineMath math="(1)" /> and <InlineMath math="(3)" />.
