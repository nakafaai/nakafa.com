This problem falls into the category of **Inverse Proportion**. If the number of workers increases, the time required to complete the work decreases, and vice versa.

Given:

- <InlineMath math="x" /> workers can complete the order in <InlineMath math="20" /> days.
- The order must be completed in <InlineMath math="5" /> days with <InlineMath math="P" /> workers.

The relationship between the number of workers and the work time can be written as:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\text{Number of workers}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = \text{Number of workers}_2 \times \text{Time}_2" />
</MathContainer>

Substitute the known values:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="x \cdot 20 = P \cdot 5" />
  <BlockMath math="20x = 5P" />
</MathContainer>

Then the value of <InlineMath math="P" /> is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P = \frac{20x}{5}" />
  <BlockMath math="P = 4x" />
</MathContainer>

It is known that <InlineMath math="Q = 4x" />.

Therefore:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P = 4x \quad \text{and} \quad Q = 4x" />
  <BlockMath math="P = Q" />
</MathContainer>

So, the correct relationship is <InlineMath math="P = Q" />.
