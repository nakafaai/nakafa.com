Let Andi's initial money be <InlineMath math="A" />, Budi's money be <InlineMath math="B" />, and Cici's money be <InlineMath math="C" />.

Given that Andi's money is four times Budi's money, we can write the equation:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="A = 4B \implies B = \frac{1}{4}A" />
</MathContainer>

If Andi donates Rp4,000.00, his remaining money is <InlineMath math="A - 4,000" />.

If Budi spends Rp1,000.00, his remaining money is <InlineMath math="B - 1,000" />.

It is known that the remainder of Andi's money is equal to the remainder of Budi's money plus Cici's money. The equation is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="A - 4,000 = (B - 1,000) + C" />
</MathContainer>

Next, substitute <InlineMath math="B = \frac{1}{4}A" /> into the equation to find the value of <InlineMath math="A" />:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="A - 4,000 = \left(\frac{1}{4}A - 1,000\right) + C" />
  <BlockMath math="A - \frac{1}{4}A = 4,000 - 1,000 + C" />
  <BlockMath math="\frac{3}{4}A = 3,000 + C" />
</MathContainer>

Multiply both sides by <InlineMath math="\frac{4}{3}" />:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="A = \frac{4}{3}(3,000 + C)" />
  <BlockMath math="A = 4,000 + \frac{4}{3}C" />
  <BlockMath math="A = \frac{4}{3}C + 4,000" />
</MathContainer>

So, Andi's initial money is <InlineMath math="\frac{4}{3}C + \text{Rp}4,000.00" />.
