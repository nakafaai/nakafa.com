There are two boxes, both containing black and white balls. The number of balls in each box is <InlineMath math="20" />. One ball is taken from each box, and the probability that both balls are black is <InlineMath math="\frac{3}{10}" />. If the probability that both balls are white is <InlineMath math="\frac{m}{n}" />, then <InlineMath math="m + n = \dots" />
