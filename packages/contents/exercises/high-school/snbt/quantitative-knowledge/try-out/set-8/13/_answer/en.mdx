The fewer workers there are, the longer it takes to complete the work. Thus, this is an inverse proportion.

Let <InlineMath math="x =" /> days required.

<BlockMath math="\begin{aligned} \frac{20}{15} &= \frac{x}{12} \\ x &= 16 \end{aligned}" />

So, the time required to complete the order if only <InlineMath math="15" /> people are working is <InlineMath math="16" /> days. Therefore, the additional time required is:

<BlockMath math="16 - 12 = 4 \text{ days}" />
