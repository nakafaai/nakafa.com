Since the water in the hemispherical container is transferred to the cylindrical container, the volume of water remains the same.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="V_{\text{hemisphere}} = V_{\text{cylinder}}" />
  <BlockMath math="\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \pi \cdot r^3 = \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot t" />
</MathContainer>

Since the radius of the sphere is the same as the radius of the cylinder, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by <InlineMath math="\pi \cdot r^2" />:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\frac{2}{3} \cdot r = t" />
</MathContainer>

Given that the radius <InlineMath math="r = 15 \text{ cm}" />. We substitute this value into the equation:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="\frac{2}{3} \cdot 15 = t" />
  <BlockMath math="t = 10 \text{ cm}" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, the height of the water in the cylinder is <InlineMath math="10 \text{ cm}" />.
