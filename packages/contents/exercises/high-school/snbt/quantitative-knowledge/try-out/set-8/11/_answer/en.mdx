Let:
- <InlineMath math="J_A =" /> Distance traveled by Ali until they meet
- <InlineMath math="J_T =" /> Distance traveled by Tika until they meet
- <InlineMath math="v_A =" /> Ali's speed <InlineMath math="= 60" /> km/h
- <InlineMath math="v_T =" /> Tika's speed <InlineMath math="= 70" /> km/h

Since Ali and Tika depart at the same time, the time they take to meet is also the same. Let <InlineMath math="t =" /> time.

Then:

<BlockMath math="\begin{aligned} J_A &= v_A \times t = 60t \\ J_T &= v_T \times t = 70t \end{aligned}" />

Since the total distance is <InlineMath math="221" /> km, then:

<BlockMath math="\begin{aligned} J_A + J_T &= 221 \\ 60t + 70t &= 221 \\ 130t &= 221 \\ t &= 1.7 \text{ hours} \end{aligned}" />

So the time required until they meet is:

<BlockMath math="1.7 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour } 42 \text{ minutes}" />

Thus, they will meet at:

<BlockMath math="09.15 + 1 \text{ hour } 42 \text{ minutes} = 10.57" />
