The average test score of class <InlineMath math="A" /> is <InlineMath math="\bar{X}_A" /> and the average test score of class <InlineMath math="B" /> is <InlineMath math="\bar{X}_B" />. After the scores of both classes are combined, the average score becomes <InlineMath math="\bar{X}" />. If <InlineMath math="\bar{X}_A : \bar{X}_B = 9 : 10" /> and <InlineMath math="\bar{X} : \bar{X}_A = 84 : 81" />, then the ratio of the number of students in class <InlineMath math="A" /> to class <InlineMath math="B" /> is...
