Given the area of the large square is <InlineMath math="256 \text{ cm}^2" />.

#### Finding the Side Length of the Large Square

The area of a square (<InlineMath math="A" />) is given by <InlineMath math="A = s^2" />.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="s^2 = 256" />
  <BlockMath math="s = \sqrt{256} = 16 \text{ cm}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Finding the Diameter of the Circle

Notice that the circle is inscribed in the large square, tangent to its sides. Therefore, the diameter of the circle (<InlineMath math="d" />) is equal to the side length of the large square.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="d = s = 16 \text{ cm}" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating the Circumference of the Circle

The circumference of a circle (<InlineMath math="C" />) is given by <InlineMath math="C = \pi d" />.

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="C = \pi \cdot 16 = 16\pi \text{ cm}" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the circumference of the circle is <InlineMath math="16\pi \text{ cm}" />.
