The number sequence <InlineMath math="5, 8, 11, \ldots" /> is an arithmetic sequence where <InlineMath math="a" /> is the first term, <InlineMath math="b" /> is the common difference, <InlineMath math="U_n" /> is the <InlineMath math="n" />-th term, and <InlineMath math="S_n" /> is the sum of the first <InlineMath math="n" /> terms.

Which statements are true based on the information above?

<BlockMath math="(1) \quad \text{The value of } a \text{ is greater than the value of } b" />

<BlockMath math="(2) \quad U_{11} = a \times 7" />

<BlockMath math="(3) \quad S_6 = b \times 25" />

<BlockMath math="(4) \quad U_{18} = S_5" />
