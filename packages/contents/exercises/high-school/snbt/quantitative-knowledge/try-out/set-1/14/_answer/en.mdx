Given the equation <InlineMath math="7 - N \times (-3) = 52" />.

#### Simplifying the Equation

First, we simplify the form <InlineMath math="N \times (-3)" /> to <InlineMath math="N(-3)" /> or <InlineMath math="-3N" />.

<BlockMath math="7 - N(-3) = 52" />

Since <InlineMath math="-N(-3) = 3N" />, the equation becomes:

<BlockMath math="7 + 3N = 52" />

#### Solving the Equation

Subtract <InlineMath math="7" /> from both sides:

<BlockMath math="7 + 3N - 7 = 52 - 7" />

<BlockMath math="3N = 45" />

Divide both sides by <InlineMath math="3" />:

<BlockMath math="N = \frac{45}{3}" />

<BlockMath math="N = 15" />

Therefore, the value of <InlineMath math="N" /> is <InlineMath math="15" />.
