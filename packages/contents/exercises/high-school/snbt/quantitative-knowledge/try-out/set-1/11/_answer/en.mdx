Given the mathematics scores of three student groups:

**Group 1:** <InlineMath math="8, 2, 5, 8, 7" />

**Group 2:** <InlineMath math="6, 9, 7" />

**Group 3:** <InlineMath math="3, b, 10, 8" />

The sum of the mode of Group 1's scores and the median of Group 2's scores is equal to <InlineMath math="2" /> times the average of Group 3's scores.

Step 1: Determine the mode of Group 1

Group 1 data: <InlineMath math="8, 2, 5, 8, 7" />

Frequency of each value:
- <InlineMath math="2" /> appears <InlineMath math="1" /> time
- <InlineMath math="5" /> appears <InlineMath math="1" /> time
- <InlineMath math="7" /> appears <InlineMath math="1" /> time
- <InlineMath math="8" /> appears <InlineMath math="2" /> times

The mode of Group 1 is <InlineMath math="8" />.

Step 2: Determine the median of Group 2

Group 2 data: <InlineMath math="6, 9, 7" />

Sort the data: <InlineMath math="6, 7, 9" />

Since the number of data points is odd (<InlineMath math="3" />), the median is the middle value, which is <InlineMath math="7" />.

Step 3: Determine the average of Group 3

Group 3 data: <InlineMath math="3, b, 10, 8" />

Average of Group 3:

<BlockMath math="\bar{X}_3 = \frac{3 + b + 10 + 8}{4} = \frac{21 + b}{4}" />

Step 4: Set up the equation

Based on the given information:

<BlockMath math="\text{Mode of Group 1} + \text{Median of Group 2} = 2 \times \text{Average of Group 3}" />

<BlockMath math="8 + 7 = 2 \times \frac{21 + b}{4}" />

<BlockMath math="15 = \frac{21 + b}{2}" />

Multiply both sides by <InlineMath math="2" />:

<BlockMath math="30 = 21 + b" />

<BlockMath math="b = 9" />

So the value <InlineMath math="b = 9" />, thus <InlineMath math="P = 9" /> and <InlineMath math="Q = 8" />.

Since <InlineMath math="P = 9" /> and <InlineMath math="Q = 8" />, we have <InlineMath math="P > Q" />.

Therefore, quantity <InlineMath math="P" /> is greater than quantity <InlineMath math="Q" />.
