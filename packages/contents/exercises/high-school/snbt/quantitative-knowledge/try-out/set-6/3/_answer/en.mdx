Let <InlineMath math="B" /> be a boy and <InlineMath math="G" /> be a girl.

The sample space for a family with <InlineMath math="3" /> children (without conditions) has <InlineMath math="2^3 = 8" /> possibilities:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="S_{total} = \{BBB, BBG, BGB, BGG, GBB, GBG, GGB, GGG\}" />
</MathContainer>

It is given that "at least one child is a girl". This means the event "all children are boys" (<InlineMath math="BBB" />) is impossible.

The new sample space (<InlineMath math="S" />) consists of all possibilities except <InlineMath math="BBB" />:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="S = \{BBG, BGB, BGG, GBB, GBG, GGB, GGG\}" />
</MathContainer>

The number of elements in the sample space is <InlineMath math="n(S) = 7" />.

The expected event (<InlineMath math="A" />) is having <InlineMath math="2" /> girls and <InlineMath math="1" /> boy.

From the sample space <InlineMath math="S" />, the outcomes that satisfy this condition are:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="A = \{BGG, GBG, GGB\}" />
</MathContainer>

The number of expected outcomes is <InlineMath math="n(A) = 3" />.

The probability of the event is:

<MathContainer>
  <BlockMath math="P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)} = \frac{3}{7}" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the probability that the family has <InlineMath math="2" /> girls and <InlineMath math="1" /> boy is <InlineMath math="\frac{3}{7}" />.
