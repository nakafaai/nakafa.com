To calculate the area under the curve, first find the intersection points of the curve with the x-axis to determine the integration bounds.

#### Finding Intersection with the x-axis

The region is bounded by the curve <InlineMath math="f(x) = 6x - x^2" /> and the x-axis <InlineMath math="(y = 0)" />

The intersection points of the curve with the x-axis are obtained when <InlineMath math="f(x) = 0" />

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="6x - x^2 = 0" />

<BlockMath math="x(6 - x) = 0" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, <InlineMath math="x = 0" /> or <InlineMath math="x = 6" />

#### Determining Integration Bounds

Since the question asks for <InlineMath math="x \geq 0" />, the integration bounds are from <InlineMath math="x = 0" /> to <InlineMath math="x = 6" />

#### Calculating the Area

The area under the curve <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> from <InlineMath math="x = 0" /> to <InlineMath math="x = 6" /> is calculated using a definite integral

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\text{Area} = \int_0^6 (6x - x^2) dx" />
</MathContainer>

#### Evaluating the Integral

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\int (6x - x^2) dx = 3x^2 - \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C" />
</MathContainer>

#### Applying Integration Bounds

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\text{Area} = \left[3x^2 - \frac{1}{3}x^3\right]_0^6" />

<BlockMath math="= \left[3(6)^2 - \frac{1}{3}(6)^3\right] - \left[3(0)^2 - \frac{1}{3}(0)^3\right]" />

<BlockMath math="= \left[3(36) - \frac{1}{3}(216)\right] - 0" />

<BlockMath math="= [108 - 72] - 0" />

<BlockMath math="= 108 - 72" />

<BlockMath math="= 36 \text{ square units}" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the area bounded by the curve and the x-axis is <InlineMath math="36" /> square units.
