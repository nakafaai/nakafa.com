A square with corner points at <InlineMath math="(0, 0)" />, <InlineMath math="(2, 0)" />, <InlineMath math="(2, 2)" />, and <InlineMath math="(0, 2)" /> is subjected to two linear transformations in sequence.

The first transformation <InlineMath math="(T_1)" /> is a scale with factor <InlineMath math="2" /> on the x-axis and factor <InlineMath math="0.5" /> on the y-axis. The second transformation <InlineMath math="(T_2)" /> is a shear with factor <InlineMath math="1" /> along the x-axis.

Evaluate the area of the square after both transformations!
