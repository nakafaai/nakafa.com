#### Position Vector of Point A

Let the position vector of point <InlineMath math="A" /> be <InlineMath math="\mathbf{a}" />

Since <InlineMath math="A" /> lies on a circle with center <InlineMath math="O" />, the vector <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{OA} = \mathbf{a}" /> is the radius of the circle.

#### Tangent Line at Point A

The tangent line at point <InlineMath math="A" /> is a line that touches the circle at point <InlineMath math="A" /> and is perpendicular to the radius <InlineMath math="OA" /> at that point.

#### Direction Vector of Tangent Line

Let the direction vector of the tangent line at point <InlineMath math="A" /> be <InlineMath math="\mathbf{t}" />

Since the tangent line is perpendicular to the radius <InlineMath math="OA" /> (vector <InlineMath math="\mathbf{a}" />), the direction vector of the tangent line <InlineMath math="\mathbf{t}" /> must be perpendicular to vector <InlineMath math="\mathbf{a}" />

#### Perpendicular Vector Condition

Two vectors are perpendicular if and only if their dot product is zero

<BlockMath math="\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{t} = 0" />

#### Conclusion

Therefore, to prove that the tangent line at <InlineMath math="A" /> is perpendicular to the radius <InlineMath math="OA" />, we need to show that the dot product of vector <InlineMath math="\mathbf{a}" /> and vector <InlineMath math="\mathbf{t}" /> is zero

<BlockMath math="\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{t} = 0" />

This is the vector representation to prove that the tangent line of the circle at point <InlineMath math="A" /> is perpendicular to the radius <InlineMath math="OA" />

The most appropriate answer is C.
