A mathematical model for the sea water height <InlineMath math="H" /> at a port as a function of time <InlineMath math="t" /> in hours is given by the function <InlineMath math="H(t) = A \cos(Bt) + C" />

The data shows that the maximum sea water height is <InlineMath math="10" /> meters and the minimum is <InlineMath math="2" /> meters. The complete tidal period is <InlineMath math="12" /> hours.

Analyze the values of <InlineMath math="A" />, <InlineMath math="B" />, and <InlineMath math="C" /> from the function based on the given data.
