The path is calculated from the box to B10, forming an arithmetic sequence of distances <InlineMath math="10, 18, 26, 34, \ldots" />

#### Determining Series Parameters

From the series <InlineMath math="10, 18, 26, 34, \ldots" />, we get

- First term <InlineMath math="a = 10" />
- Common difference <InlineMath math="b = 18 - 10 = 8" />
- Number of terms <InlineMath math="n = 10" /> (from box to B10)

#### Calculating the 10th Term

The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic series

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="U_n = a + (n - 1)b" />

<BlockMath math="U_{10} = 10 + (10 - 1) \cdot 8" />

<BlockMath math="= 10 + 9 \cdot 8" />

<BlockMath math="= 10 + 72 = 82" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating the Sum of Series

The sum of distances from the box to B10

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a + U_n)" />

<BlockMath math="S_{10} = \frac{10}{2}(a + U_{10})" />

<BlockMath math="= 5(10 + 82)" />

<BlockMath math="= 5 \cdot 92 = 460" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the distance from the start to the box is <InlineMath math="460" /> meters
