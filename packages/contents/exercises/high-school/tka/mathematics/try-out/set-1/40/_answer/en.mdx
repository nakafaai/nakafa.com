To solve this combination problem, first determine which questions are required and how many questions still need to be selected.

#### Identifying the Conditions

1. Total number of questions is <InlineMath math="10" /> questions
2. Questions to be worked on are <InlineMath math="7" /> questions
3. Required questions are numbers <InlineMath math="1" />, <InlineMath math="2" />, and <InlineMath math="3" />

#### Determining Questions to be Selected

Since participants must work on questions number <InlineMath math="1" />, <InlineMath math="2" />, and <InlineMath math="3" />, participants have already worked on <InlineMath math="3" /> questions.

Questions still to be selected

<BlockMath math="7 - 3 = 4 \text{ questions}" />

#### Determining Available Questions to Choose From

Available questions to choose from are those other than numbers <InlineMath math="1" />, <InlineMath math="2" />, and <InlineMath math="3" />

Number of available questions to choose from

<BlockMath math="10 - 3 = 7 \text{ questions}" />

#### Calculating the Number of Ways to Choose

Participants must choose <InlineMath math="4" /> questions from <InlineMath math="7" /> available questions. Use combination

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="C_4^7 = \frac{7!}{(7-4)! \cdot 4!}" />

<BlockMath math="= \frac{7!}{3! \cdot 4!}" />

<BlockMath math="= \frac{7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4!}{3! \cdot 4!}" />

<BlockMath math="= \frac{7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}" />

<BlockMath math="= \frac{210}{6}" />

<BlockMath math="= 35" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the number of ways participants can choose the questions to work on is <InlineMath math="35" /> ways.
