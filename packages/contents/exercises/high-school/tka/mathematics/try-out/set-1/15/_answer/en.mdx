Given an arithmetic series with <InlineMath math="S_n = 2n^2 + 4n" />

#### Determining the nth Term Formula

If <InlineMath math="U_n = S_n - S_{n-1}" />, then

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="U_n = (2n^2 + 4n) - (2(n-1)^2 + 4(n-1))" />

<BlockMath math="= 2n^2 + 4n - (2(n^2 - 2n + 1) + 4n - 4)" />

<BlockMath math="= 2n^2 + 4n - (2n^2 - 4n + 2 + 4n - 4)" />

<BlockMath math="= 2n^2 + 4n - 2n^2 + 4n - 2 - 4n + 4" />

<BlockMath math="= 4n + 2" />
</MathContainer>

#### Calculating the 10th Term

The 10th term of the series is

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="U_n = 4n + 2" />

<BlockMath math="U_{10} = 4(10) + 2" />

<BlockMath math="= 40 + 2 = 42" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the 10th term of the series is <InlineMath math="42" />
