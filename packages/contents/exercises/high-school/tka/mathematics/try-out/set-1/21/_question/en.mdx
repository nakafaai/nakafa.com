A circle with center at the origin <InlineMath math="O" /> and radius <InlineMath math="r" /> is given. Points <InlineMath math="A" /> and <InlineMath math="B" /> lie on the circle such that <InlineMath math="OA" /> and <InlineMath math="OB" /> are radii.

Create a vector representation to prove that the tangent line of the circle at point <InlineMath math="A" /> is perpendicular to the radius <InlineMath math="OA" />!
