To solve this probability problem, first determine the sample space and the required events.

#### Determining the Sample Space

When two dice are thrown together, the total possible outcomes are

<BlockMath math="n(S) = 6 \times 6 = 36" />

#### Event A with Sum of Dice Equal to 5

The pairs of dice with sum 5 are <InlineMath math="(1,4)" />, <InlineMath math="(4,1)" />, <InlineMath math="(2,3)" />, <InlineMath math="(3,2)" />

The number of outcomes in event A is <InlineMath math="n(A) = 4" />

Probability of event A

<BlockMath math="P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)} = \frac{4}{36}" />

#### Event B with Sum of Dice Equal to 7

The pairs of dice with sum 7 are <InlineMath math="(2,5)" />, <InlineMath math="(5,2)" />, <InlineMath math="(4,3)" />, <InlineMath math="(3,4)" />, <InlineMath math="(6,1)" />, <InlineMath math="(1,6)" />

The number of outcomes in event B is <InlineMath math="n(B) = 6" />

Probability of event B

<BlockMath math="P(B) = \frac{n(B)}{n(S)} = \frac{6}{36}" />

#### Calculating the Combined Probability

Since events A and B are mutually exclusive (cannot occur simultaneously), then

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)" />

<BlockMath math="= \frac{4}{36} + \frac{6}{36}" />

<BlockMath math="= \frac{10}{36}" />
</MathContainer>

Therefore, the probability that the sum of the dice is 5 or 7 is <InlineMath math="\frac{10}{36}" />
