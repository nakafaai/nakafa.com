Given the function <InlineMath math="y = \sqrt{x^2 - 7}" />. The derivative of this function is

<BlockMath math="y' = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 - 7}}" />

#### Testing the first statement

The ordinate of the point on the curve with abscissa <InlineMath math="4" /> is

<BlockMath math="f(4) = \sqrt{4^2 - 7} = \sqrt{9} = 3" />

The gradient of the tangent line at point <InlineMath math="(4,3)" /> can be found by substituting <InlineMath math="x = 4" /> into the derivative.

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="y' = f'(x) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 - 7}}" />

<BlockMath math="f'(4) = \frac{4}{\sqrt{4^2 - 7}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{9}} = \frac{4}{3}" />
</MathContainer>

With gradient <InlineMath math="m = \frac{4}{3}" /> and point <InlineMath math="(4,3)" />, the equation of the tangent line is

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)" />

<BlockMath math="y - 3 = \frac{4}{3}(x - 4)" />

<BlockMath math="y - 3 = \frac{4}{3}x - \frac{16}{3}" />

<BlockMath math="y = \frac{4}{3}x - \frac{7}{3}" />
</MathContainer>

The first statement is correct.

#### Testing the second statement

For values of <InlineMath math="x" /> and <InlineMath math="y" /> that satisfy the condition, square both sides.

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="y = \sqrt{x^2 - 7}" />

<BlockMath math="y^2 = \left(\sqrt{x^2 - 7}\right)^2" />

<BlockMath math="y^2 = x^2 - 7" />

<BlockMath math="x^2 - y^2 = 7" />
</MathContainer>

The form <InlineMath math="x^2 - y^2 = 7" /> is not the equation of a circle.

The second statement is incorrect.

#### Testing the third statement

The line <InlineMath math="y = -\frac{3}{4}x + 6" /> has gradient <InlineMath math="m_1 = -\frac{3}{4}" />.

From the first statement, the gradient of the tangent line at <InlineMath math="x = 4" /> is <InlineMath math="m_2 = \frac{4}{3}" />.

Check if both lines are perpendicular by multiplying both gradients.

<BlockMath math="m_1 \cdot m_2 = -\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = -1" />

Since <InlineMath math="m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1" />, both lines are perpendicular.

The third statement is correct.

#### Testing the fourth statement

Check if the curve passes through point <InlineMath math="(4, -3)" /> by substituting the value <InlineMath math="x = 4" />.

<BlockMath math="y = \sqrt{4^2 - 7} = \sqrt{9} = 3" />

The curve does not pass through point <InlineMath math="(4, -3)" />, but passes through point <InlineMath math="(4,3)" />.

The fourth statement is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct statements are the first and third.
