The given sequence can be written as

<BlockMath math="-\frac{1}{2^1}, \frac{3}{2^2}, -\frac{1}{2^3}, \frac{3}{2^4}, ..." />

We can simplify it into a general form where

For odd <InlineMath math="n" />, the <InlineMath math="n" />th term is <InlineMath math="u_n = -\frac{1}{2^n}" />

For even <InlineMath math="n" />, the <InlineMath math="n" />th term is <InlineMath math="u_n = \frac{3}{2^n}" />

Therefore, the <InlineMath math="12" />th term or even term is

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="u_n = \frac{3}{2^n}" />

<BlockMath math="u_{12} = \frac{3}{2^{12}}" />
</MathContainer>
