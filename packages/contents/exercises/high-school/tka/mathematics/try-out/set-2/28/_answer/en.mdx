Since both quadratic equations have the same roots, their coefficients can be equated.

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="2x^2 - (a + 3)x + (3b - 2) = 2(x^2 - ax + b)" />

<BlockMath math="2x^2 - (a + 3)x + (3b - 2) = 2x^2 - 2ax + 2b" />
</MathContainer>

#### Testing the first statement

Equate the coefficient of <InlineMath math="x" /> from both equations.

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="-(a + 3) = -2a" />

<BlockMath math="-a - 3 = -2a" />

<BlockMath math="a = 3" />
</MathContainer>

The first statement is correct.

#### Testing the second statement

Equate the constant from both equations.

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="3b - 2 = 2b" />

<BlockMath math="b = 2" />
</MathContainer>

The second statement is correct.

#### Testing the third statement

Substitute the values <InlineMath math="a = 3" /> and <InlineMath math="b = 2" /> into the third statement.

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="2a - 2ab + 3b = 2(3) - 2(3)(2) + 3(2)" />

<BlockMath math="2a - 2ab + 3b = 6 - 12 + 6" />

<BlockMath math="2a - 2ab + 3b = 0" />
</MathContainer>

The third statement is correct.

#### Testing the fourth statement

Substitute the values <InlineMath math="a = 3" /> and <InlineMath math="b = 2" /> into the fourth statement.

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="ab = (2)(3) = 6" />
</MathContainer>

The fourth statement is incorrect because the result is not <InlineMath math="5" />.

Therefore, the correct statements are the first, second, and third.
