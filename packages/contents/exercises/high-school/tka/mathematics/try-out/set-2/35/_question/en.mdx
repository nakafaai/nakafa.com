Given that the polynomial <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> divided by <InlineMath math="x^2 + 3x + 2" /> has a remainder of <InlineMath math="3bx + a - 2" /> and divided by <InlineMath math="x^2 - 2x - 3" /> has a remainder of <InlineMath math="ax - 2b" />. If <InlineMath math="f(3) + f(-2) = 6" />, then <InlineMath math="a + b = " />....
