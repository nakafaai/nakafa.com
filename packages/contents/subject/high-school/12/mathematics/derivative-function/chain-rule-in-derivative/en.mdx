## Understanding Composite Functions

Imagine you have a machine that transforms a number (the first function), and its result is immediately fed into another machine to be processed again (the second function). This process is called a **composite function**. Mathematically, if we have <InlineMath math="g(x)" /> as the **inner function** and <InlineMath math="f(u)" /> as the **outer function**, their composition is <InlineMath math="y = f(g(x))" />.

The chain rule is a method for finding the derivative of functions like this, where one function is "nested" inside another.

## The Chain Rule Theorem

To differentiate a composite function, we can't just differentiate it piece by piece. There's an elegant rule that connects the derivative of the outer function with the derivative of the inner function.

> If <InlineMath math="y = f(g(x))" />, then its derivative is the product of the derivative of the outer function with respect to the inner function and the derivative of the inner function itself.

Formally, if we let <InlineMath math="u = g(x)" />, then <InlineMath math="y = f(u)" />. Its derivative is defined as:

<BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}" />

This formula is known as the **chain rule**. Essentially, we differentiate from the outermost "layer" to the innermost layer and then multiply the results.

## Applying the Chain Rule

Let's try applying this theorem to a few cases to get a better feel for it.

### Power Form Functions

Find the first derivative of <InlineMath math="y = (x^2 - 4x - 2)^8" />.

**Solution:**

First, we need to break this function down into two parts: an outer function and an inner function.

-   **Inner function** (<InlineMath math="u" />) is the expression inside the parentheses: <InlineMath math="u = x^2 - 4x - 2" />.
-   **Outer function** (<InlineMath math="y" />) is the power operation: <InlineMath math="y = u^8" />.

Next, we find the derivative of each function:

-   Derivative of the inner function: <InlineMath math="\frac{du}{dx} = 2x - 4" />.
-   Derivative of the outer function: <InlineMath math="\frac{dy}{du} = 8u^7" />.

Now, we can combine them using the chain rule:
<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
    <BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}" />
    <BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = 8u^7 \cdot (2x - 4)" />
</div>

Finally, we substitute <InlineMath math="u" /> back in and simplify the expression:
<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
    <BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = 8(x^2 - 4x - 2)^7 (2x - 4)" />
    <BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = (16x - 32)(x^2 - 4x - 2)^7" />
</div>

### Trigonometric Functions

Find the first derivative of <InlineMath math="y = \cos^4(3 - 4x)" />.

**Solution:**

We can rewrite this function as <InlineMath math="y = (\cos(3 - 4x))^4" />. This is a case where we need to apply the chain rule more than once because there are three layers of functions.

-   **Innermost function**: <InlineMath math="v = 3 - 4x" />
-   **Middle function**: <InlineMath math="u = \cos(v)" />
-   **Outermost function**: <InlineMath math="y = u^4" />

Then, we differentiate each layer:

-   Derivative of the outermost function: <InlineMath math="\frac{dy}{du} = 4u^3" />
-   Derivative of the middle function: <InlineMath math="\frac{du}{dv} = -\sin(v)" />
-   Derivative of the innermost function: <InlineMath math="\frac{dv}{dx} = -4" />

Combine them all using the chain rule:
<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
    <BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dv} \cdot \frac{dv}{dx}" />
    <BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = (4u^3) \cdot (-\sin(v)) \cdot (-4)" />
</div>

Now, substitute <InlineMath math="u" /> and <InlineMath math="v" /> back in step-by-step to get the final result:
<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
    <BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = (4\cos^3(v)) \cdot (-\sin(v)) \cdot (-4)" />
    <BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = 16\cos^3(v)\sin(v)" />
    <BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = 16\cos^3(3 - 4x)\sin(3 - 4x)" />
</div>

## Exercises

1.  Find the first derivative of <InlineMath math="y = (3x^2 - 1)^3" />.
2.  Find the first derivative of <InlineMath math="y = \sin^3(2x)" />.

### Answer Key

1.  **Solution for <InlineMath math="y = (3x^2 - 1)^3" />**

    **Step 1: Identify the functions**
    -   Inner function: <InlineMath math="u = 3x^2 - 1" />
    -   Outer function: <InlineMath math="y = u^3" />

    **Step 2: Find the derivative of each**
    -   <InlineMath math="\frac{du}{dx} = 6x" />
    -   <InlineMath math="\frac{dy}{du} = 3u^2" />

    **Step 3: Combine with the chain rule**
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}" />
        <BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = 3u^2 \cdot 6x = 18x \cdot u^2" />
    </div>
    
    **Step 4: Don't forget to substitute back**
    <BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = 18x(3x^2 - 1)^2" />

2.  **Solution for <InlineMath math="y = \sin^3(2x)" />**

    This function is <InlineMath math="y = (\sin(2x))^3" />. We'll use the multi-layered chain rule.

    **Step 1: Identify the functions**
    -   Innermost function: <InlineMath math="v = 2x" />
    -   Middle function: <InlineMath math="u = \sin(v)" />
    -   Outermost function: <InlineMath math="y = u^3" />

    **Step 2: Find the derivative of each**
    -   <InlineMath math="\frac{dv}{dx} = 2" />
    -   <InlineMath math="\frac{du}{dv} = \cos(v)" />
    -   <InlineMath math="\frac{dy}{du} = 3u^2" />

    **Step 3: Combine with the chain rule**
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dv} \cdot \frac{dv}{dx}" />
        <BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = (3u^2) \cdot (\cos(v)) \cdot (2)" />
    </div>

    **Step 4: Substitute back and simplify**
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = 6u^2 \cos(v)" />
        <BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = 6\sin^2(v) \cos(v)" />
        <BlockMath math="\frac{dy}{dx} = 6\sin^2(2x) \cos(2x)" />
    </div>
