## The Idea Behind Derivatives

Imagine you're riding a bicycle on a hilly road. Sometimes the road is steep, and other times it's flat. The **slope** of the road changes at every point you pass. In mathematics, the graph of a function can be thought of as this hilly road.

For a straight line, the slope is always the same at every point. However, for a curved line, the slope is constantly changing. Well, a **derivative** is a powerful tool in mathematics that allows us to find the precise slope or rate of change at **one specific point** on a curve.

## Gradient of a Secant Line

To understand the concept of a derivative, let's start with something simpler: a **secant line** (or a cutting line). A secant line is a straight line that intersects a curve at two different points.

Suppose we have a curve from the function <InlineMath math="y = f(x)" />. We pick two points on that curve, let's call them point <InlineMath math="P(x, f(x))" /> and point <InlineMath math="Q(x+\Delta x, f(x+\Delta x))" />. Here, <InlineMath math="\Delta x" /> (read "delta x") represents a small change in the value of <InlineMath math="x" />.

The slope (gradient) of the secant line passing through points <InlineMath math="P" /> and <InlineMath math="Q" /> can be calculated with a formula we already know:

<BlockMath math="m_{\text{secant}} = \frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x} = \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}" />

The gradient of this secant line gives us an idea of the **average rate of change** of the function <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> between points <InlineMath math="P" /> and <InlineMath math="Q" />.

    const p1_secant = { x: 1, y: f(1), z: 0 };

## From Secant Line to Tangent Line

Now, what happens if we move point <InlineMath math="Q" /> closer and closer to point <InlineMath math="P" />? The distance between them, which is <InlineMath math="\Delta x" />, will become very small, approaching zero.

When <InlineMath math="\Delta x \to 0" /> (read "delta x approaches zero"), the secant line we have will gradually transform into a **tangent line**. A tangent line is a line that touches the curve at exactly one point (in this case, point <InlineMath math="P" />).

The slope of this tangent line is what truly represents the **slope of the curve** at point <InlineMath math="P" />. To find it, we use the concept of a **limit**.

<BlockMath math="m_{\text{tangent}} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}" />

## Definition of the Derivative

The limit of the gradient of the secant line as <InlineMath math="\Delta x" /> approaches zero is so important that it is given a special name: the **derivative**.

The derivative of a function <InlineMath math="f(x)" />, denoted as <InlineMath math="f'(x)" /> (read "f prime x"), is defined as:

<BlockMath math="f'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}" />

The process of finding this derivative is called **differentiation**.

> The derivative <InlineMath math="f'(x)" /> is essentially a new function that tells us the **instantaneous rate of change** (or the slope of the tangent line) of the original function <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> at every point <InlineMath math="x" /> where the limit exists. This is the foundation of differential calculus.
