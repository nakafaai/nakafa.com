## Understanding Function Composition

Imagine you are shopping at a store that offers two attractive promos:

1.  **Promo A:** 20% discount, then another deduction of Rp25,000.00.
2.  **Promo B:** Price reduction of Rp25,000.00, then a 20% discount.

Do both promos result in the same final price? Which promo is more beneficial? To answer this, we need to understand the concept of **function composition**.

### Definition of Function Composition

Function composition is the sequential combination of two or more functions to produce a new function.

If we have a function <InlineMath math="g: A \to B" /> and a function <InlineMath math="f: B \to C" />, then their composition, written as <InlineMath math="(f \circ g)(x)" />, is a new function that maps directly from the domain <InlineMath math="A" /> to the codomain <InlineMath math="C" />.

This means we apply function <InlineMath math="g" /> first, and then we input its result into function <InlineMath math="f" />.

Mathematically, this is written as:

<BlockMath math="(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))" />

### Promo Calculation

Let's calculate the final price for an item worth Rp200,000.00 using both promos with the concept of functions.

Let <InlineMath math="x" /> be the initial price of the item.

- **20% discount function:** <InlineMath math="d(x) = x - 0.20x = 0.80x" />
- **Rp25,000.00 reduction function:** <InlineMath math="p(x) = x - 25000" />

Now let's compose these two functions according to the promo sequence:

1.  **Promo A (Discount first, then price reduction):** We are looking for <InlineMath math="(p \circ d)(x)" />

    <BlockMath math="(p \circ d)(x) = p(d(x)) = p(0.80x) = 0.80x - 25000" />

    For <InlineMath math="x = 200000" />:

    <BlockMath math="(p \circ d)(200000) = 0.80(200000) - 25000 = 160000 - 25000 = 135000" />

    So, the final price with Promo A is Rp135,000.00.

2.  **Promo B (Price reduction first, then discount):** We are looking for <InlineMath math="(d \circ p)(x)" />

    <BlockMath math="(d \circ p)(x) = d(p(x)) = d(x - 25000) = 0.80(x - 25000) = 0.80x - 20000" />

    For <InlineMath math="x = 200000" />:

    <BlockMath math="(d \circ p)(200000) = 0.80(200000) - 20000 = 160000 - 20000 = 140000" />

    So, the final price with Promo B is Rp140,000.00.

It turns out that the order of applying the functions (discount and price reduction) affects the final result. Promo A (<InlineMath math="p \circ d" />) is more beneficial for the buyer than Promo B (<InlineMath math="d \circ p" />) for an item priced at Rp200,000.00. This demonstrates that, generally, <InlineMath math="(f \circ g)(x) \neq (g \circ f)(x)" />.

## Another Example

Suppose we have two functions:

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
  <BlockMath math="f(x) = 2x + 1" />
  <BlockMath math="g(x) = x^2 - 3" />
</div>

Determine <InlineMath math="(f \circ g)(x)" /> and <InlineMath math="(g \circ f)(x)" />.

**Solution:**

1.  **Finding <InlineMath math="(f \circ g)(x)" />:**

    <BlockMath math="(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x^2 - 3)" />

    Substitute <InlineMath math="x" /> in <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> with <InlineMath math="g(x)" />:

    <BlockMath math="f(x^2 - 3) = 2(x^2 - 3) + 1 = 2x^2 - 6 + 1 = 2x^2 - 5" />

    So, <InlineMath math="(f \circ g)(x) = 2x^2 - 5" />.

2.  **Finding <InlineMath math="(g \circ f)(x)" />:**

    <BlockMath math="(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(2x + 1)" />

    Substitute <InlineMath math="x" /> in <InlineMath math="g(x)" /> with <InlineMath math="f(x)" />:

    <BlockMath math="g(2x + 1) = (2x + 1)^2 - 3 = (4x^2 + 4x + 1) - 3 = 4x^2 + 4x - 2" />

    So, <InlineMath math="(g \circ f)(x) = 4x^2 + 4x - 2" />.

Note that <InlineMath math="(f \circ g)(x) \neq (g \circ f)(x)" />, illustrating the non-commutative property.
