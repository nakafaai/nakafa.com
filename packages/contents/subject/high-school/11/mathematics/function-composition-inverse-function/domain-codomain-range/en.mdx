## Domain

The Domain is like the VIP guest list for our function machine. It is the **collection of all input values that are allowed** into the function. If a value is not on the list (domain), it cannot enter the function machine.

### Finding the Domain Example

Suppose we have a function like this:

<BlockMath math="f(x) = \frac{1}{x}" />

This machine works by dividing 1 by the number you input. Can we input all numbers? Try inputting the number 0.

<BlockMath math="f(0) = \frac{1}{0}" />

Oops, we cannot divide by zero! That's not allowed in mathematics. So, the number 0 is not included in the guest list (domain) for this function. All other numbers are allowed.

So, the domain of the function <InlineMath math="f(x) = \frac{1}{x}" /> is all real numbers except 0.

Another example:

<BlockMath math="g(x) = \sqrt{x}" />

This machine finds the square root of the input. Can we input negative numbers, for example -4?

<BlockMath math="g(-4) = \sqrt{-4}" />

In the realm of real numbers, we cannot take the square root of a negative number. So, all negative numbers are not allowed. Only 0 and positive numbers are allowed.

So, the domain of the function <InlineMath math="g(x) = \sqrt{x}" /> is all real numbers greater than or equal to 0 (<InlineMath math="x \ge 0" />).

## Codomain

The Codomain is like a **catalog of all possible outputs** that the function machine can produce. It is the set of values where we _expect_ the output to be. We determine this catalog when defining the function.

For example, let's define a function <InlineMath math="f(x) = 2x" />.
We specify the **Domain** (input) as the set of natural numbers:

<BlockMath math="\{1, 2, 3, ...\}" />

Then, we specify the **Codomain** (possible output) as the set of integers:

<BlockMath math="\{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\}" />

By defining the codomain as integers, we are stating that we _expect_ the result of the function <InlineMath math="f(x)=2x" /> to be an integer. Although we know that if the input is a natural number, the output will definitely be a positive even number (which is the Range):

<BlockMath math="\{2, 4, 6, ...\}" />
The codomain we defined (integers) is still valid because all the actual results
(range) are included in the codomain.

The codomain tells us what 'type' of value might come out, even if not all values in the codomain actually appear as results.

## Range

The Range is the **collection of all output values that are _actually_ produced** by the function when we input all members of the domain. The Range is part of (or sometimes exactly the same as) the Codomain.

**Example:**
Let's use the function <InlineMath math="f(x) = x^2" /> again.

Suppose the Domain is the set of integers:

<BlockMath math="\{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\}" />
and the Codomain is also the set of integers.

When we input values from the domain:

- <InlineMath math="f(-2) = 4" />
- <InlineMath math="f(-1) = 1" />
- <InlineMath math="f(0) = 0" />
- <InlineMath math="f(1) = 1" />
- <InlineMath math="f(2) = 4" />
- and so on...

The values that _actually_ come out as output are 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, and so on (non-negative square numbers).
So, the **Range** of this function (with this domain) is the set:

<BlockMath math="\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...\}" />

Notice that this range (<InlineMath math="\{0, 1, 4, 9, ...\}" />) is a part (subset) of the codomain we defined (integers):

<BlockMath math="\{..., -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\}" />
Not all members of the codomain are part of the range.

## Why Is This Important?

Understanding domain, codomain, and range is very important because it helps us define functions correctly and understand their limitations. Without a clear domain, we might try to input values that "break" the function (like dividing by zero). Without codomain and range, we don't know exactly what kind of output to expect.

## Mathematical Relationship

Mathematically, a function <InlineMath math="f" /> maps every element from the set Domain (<InlineMath math="D" />) to one element in the set Codomain (<InlineMath math="K" />). This is often written as:

<BlockMath math="f: D \to K" />

The Range (<InlineMath math="R" />) is the set of all actual results <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> for every <InlineMath math="x" /> in the Domain. In other words:

<BlockMath math="R = \{ f(x) \mid x \in D \}" />

The important relationship between the three is that the Range is always a subset of the Codomain:

<BlockMath math="R \subseteq K" />
This means all values that actually come out of the function (Range) must be included
in the set of values that *might* come out (Codomain), but not all values in the
Codomain must be results.
