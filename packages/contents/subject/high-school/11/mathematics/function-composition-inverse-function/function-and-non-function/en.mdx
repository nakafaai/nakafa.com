## Relations Between Sets

In mathematics, a **relation** from a set <InlineMath math="A" /> to a set <InlineMath math="B" /> is a rule that connects members of set <InlineMath math="A" /> with members of set <InlineMath math="B" />. This pairing can be in any form.

**Example:**

The "less than" relation between <InlineMath math="A = \{1, 2, 3\}" /> and <InlineMath math="B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}" /> yields the pairs <InlineMath math="(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)" />.

**Explanation:**

We look for all pairs <InlineMath math="(a, b)" /> with <InlineMath math="a \in A" /> and <InlineMath math="b \in B" /> where <InlineMath math="a < b" />.

- For <InlineMath math="a=1" /> -> <InlineMath math="1 < 2" />, <InlineMath math="1 < 3" />, <InlineMath math="1 < 4" />. Pairs: <InlineMath math="(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)" />.
- For <InlineMath math="a=2" /> -> <InlineMath math="2 < 3" />, <InlineMath math="2 < 4" />. Pairs: <InlineMath math="(2, 3), (2, 4)" />.
- For <InlineMath math="a=3" /> -> <InlineMath math="3 < 4" />. Pair: <InlineMath math="(3, 4)" />.

The combination of all these pairs is <InlineMath math="\{(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)\}" />.

## Functions as Special Relations

A **function** (or mapping) <InlineMath math="f" /> from a set <InlineMath math="A" /> to a set <InlineMath math="B" />, written <InlineMath math="f: A \to B" />, is a special relation that satisfies two conditions:

1.  **Every** element <InlineMath math="x \in A" /> must have a pair <InlineMath math="y \in B" />.

    <BlockMath math="\forall x \in A, \exists y \in B \text{ such that } (x, y) \in f" />

2.  Every element <InlineMath math="x \in A" /> has **exactly one** pair <InlineMath math="y \in B" />.

    <BlockMath math="\text{If } (x, y_1) \in f \text{ and } (x, y_2) \in f, \text{ then } y_1 = y_2" />

This means every member of the domain must be connected, and cannot have more than one connection.

## Arrow Diagram Examples

Here are visual examples of relations using arrow diagrams to distinguish between functions and non-functions.

### Relations That Are Not Functions
