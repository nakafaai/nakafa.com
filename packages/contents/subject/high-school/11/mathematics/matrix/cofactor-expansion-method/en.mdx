## What is Cofactor Expansion?

The cofactor expansion method is one way to calculate the determinant of a square matrix, especially for matrices larger than <InlineMath math="2 \times 2" />.

This method works by breaking down the calculation of a large matrix's determinant into a sum of the products of the matrix elements with their respective cofactors, which involves the determinants of smaller matrices.

## Minor of a Matrix Element

Each element in a square matrix has what is called a "minor". The minor of an element <InlineMath math="a_{ij}" /> (i.e., the element located in the <InlineMath math="i" />-th row and <InlineMath math="j" />-th column) is usually written as <InlineMath math="M_{ij}" />.

To determine the minor <InlineMath math="M_{ij}" />, we need to remove (cross out) the entire <InlineMath math="i" />-th row and the entire <InlineMath math="j" />-th column from the original matrix. The determinant of the remaining sub-matrix is what is called the minor <InlineMath math="M_{ij}" />.

### Finding the Minor

Suppose we have a <InlineMath math="3 \times 3" /> matrix <InlineMath math="A" /> as follows:

<BlockMath math="A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \end{bmatrix}" />

If we want to find the minor of the element <InlineMath math="a_{22}" /> (i.e., <InlineMath math="M_{22}" />), we remove the second row and second column from matrix <InlineMath math="A" />:

Imagine we cross it out like this:

<BlockMath math="A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & \cancel{a_{12}} & a_{13} \\ \cancel{a_{21}} & \cancel{a_{22}} & \cancel{a_{23}} \\ a_{31} & \cancel{a_{32}} & a_{33} \end{bmatrix}" />

The matrix remaining after the removal is:

<BlockMath math="\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{13} \\ a_{31} & a_{33} \end{bmatrix}" />

Thus, the minor <InlineMath math="M_{22}" /> is the determinant of this remaining matrix:

<BlockMath math="M_{22} = \det \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{13} \\ a_{31} & a_{33} \end{pmatrix} = (a_{11} \times a_{33}) - (a_{13} \times a_{31})" />

## Cofactor of a Matrix Element

After understanding what a minor is, the next step is to understand the "cofactor". The cofactor of an element <InlineMath math="a_{ij}" />, usually denoted as <InlineMath math="k_{ij}" /> or <InlineMath math="C_{ij}" />, is calculated using its minor with the formula:

<BlockMath math="k_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} M_{ij}" />

The <InlineMath math="(-1)^{i+j}" /> part in this formula determines the sign (positive or negative) of the cofactor. The rule is simple:

- If the sum <InlineMath math="i+j" /> is an even number, then <InlineMath math="(-1)^{i+j} = 1" />. This means <InlineMath math="k_{ij} = M_{ij}" /> (the cofactor is equal to its minor).
- If the sum <InlineMath math="i+j" /> is an odd number, then <InlineMath math="(-1)^{i+j} = -1" />. This means <InlineMath math="k_{ij} = -M_{ij}" /> (the cofactor is the negative of its minor).

For a <InlineMath math="3 \times 3" /> matrix, the sign pattern of <InlineMath math="(-1)^{i+j}" /> will look like this:

<BlockMath math="\begin{pmatrix} + & - & + \\ - & + & - \\ + & - & + \end{pmatrix}" />

This sign indicates whether the cofactor will be equal to its minor (sign <InlineMath math="+" />) or the negative of its minor (sign <InlineMath math="-" />).

### Finding the Cofactor

Let's continue with the example of matrix <InlineMath math="A" /> and the minor <InlineMath math="M_{22}" /> that we have already calculated.

The cofactor for element <InlineMath math="a_{22}" /> is <InlineMath math="k_{22}" />.

Since <InlineMath math="i=2" /> and <InlineMath math="j=2" />, then <InlineMath math="i+j = 2+2 = 4" /> (even).

<BlockMath math="k_{22} = (-1)^{2+2} M_{22} = (1) M_{22} = M_{22}" />

Now, let's try to find the cofactor for element <InlineMath math="a_{12}" />, which is <InlineMath math="k_{12}" />.

First, we find its minor, <InlineMath math="M_{12}" />, by removing the first row and second column from matrix <InlineMath math="A" />:

<BlockMath math="M_{12} = \det \begin{pmatrix} a_{21} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{33} \end{pmatrix} = (a_{21} \times a_{33}) - (a_{23} \times a_{31})" />

Then, we calculate its cofactor. For <InlineMath math="a_{12}" />, <InlineMath math="i=1" /> and <InlineMath math="j=2" />, so <InlineMath math="i+j = 1+2 = 3" /> (odd).

<BlockMath math="k_{12} = (-1)^{1+2} M_{12} = (-1) M_{12} = -M_{12}" />

## Calculating the Determinant using Cofactor Expansion

The core of the cofactor expansion method is to calculate the determinant of matrix <InlineMath math="A" /> (denoted <InlineMath math="\det(A)" /> or <InlineMath math="|A|" />) by choosing one row or one column from the matrix.

Then, each element in the chosen row or column is multiplied by its respective cofactor, and all these products are summed up.

**Formula for Cofactor Expansion Along the <InlineMath math="i" />-th Row:**

<BlockMath math="\det(A) = |A| = \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}k_{ij} = a_{i1}k_{i1} + a_{i2}k_{i2} + \dots + a_{in}k_{in}" />

This means we choose the <InlineMath math="i" />-th row. Then, for each column <InlineMath math="j" /> in that row, we multiply the element <InlineMath math="a_{ij}" /> by its cofactor <InlineMath math="k_{ij}" />, and sum them all.

**Formula for Cofactor Expansion Along the <InlineMath math="j" />-th Column:**

<BlockMath math="\det(A) = |A| = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{ij}k_{ij} = a_{1j}k_{1j} + a_{2j}k_{2j} + \dots + a_{nj}k_{nj}" />

This means we choose the <InlineMath math="j" />-th column. Then, for each row <InlineMath math="i" /> in that column, we multiply the element <InlineMath math="a_{ij}" /> by its cofactor <InlineMath math="k_{ij}" />, and sum them all.

The good news is, you can choose any row or column for the expansion, and the result will always be the same!

To simplify calculations, it is usually best to choose a row or column that contains many zero elements, as multiplication by zero will result in zero and reduce the number of terms to be calculated.

## Example of Determinant Calculation

Let's calculate the determinant of the following matrix <InlineMath math="P" /> using the cofactor expansion method:

<BlockMath math="P = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 2 \\ 2 & 6 & 2 \\ 5 & 9 & 4 \end{bmatrix}" />

We will perform cofactor expansion along the first row (i.e., <InlineMath math="i=1" />).

Based on the formula, the determinant of <InlineMath math="P" /> is:

<BlockMath math="\det(P) = a_{11}k_{11} + a_{12}k_{12} + a_{13}k_{13}" />

From matrix <InlineMath math="P" />, the elements of the first row are:

- <InlineMath math="a_{11} = 1" />
- <InlineMath math="a_{12} = 3" />
- <InlineMath math="a_{13} = 2" />

Now, we need to calculate the cofactors <InlineMath math="k_{11}" />, <InlineMath math="k_{12}" />, and <InlineMath math="k_{13}" />.

1.  **Calculating <InlineMath math="k_{11}" />** (<InlineMath math="i=1, j=1" />, so <InlineMath math="i+j=2" />, even):

    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <BlockMath math="M_{11} = \det \begin{pmatrix} 6 & 2 \\ 9 & 4 \end{pmatrix} = (6 \times 4) - (2 \times 9) = 24 - 18 = 6" />
      <BlockMath math="k_{11} = (-1)^{1+1} M_{11} = (1)(6) = 6" />
    </div>

2.  **Calculating <InlineMath math="k_{12}" />** (<InlineMath math="i=1, j=2" />, so <InlineMath math="i+j=3" />, odd):

    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <BlockMath math="M_{12} = \det \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\ 5 & 4 \end{pmatrix} = (2 \times 4) - (2 \times 5) = 8 - 10 = -2" />
      <BlockMath math="k_{12} = (-1)^{1+2} M_{12} = (-1)(-2) = 2" />
    </div>

3.  **Calculating <InlineMath math="k_{13}" />** (<InlineMath math="i=1, j=3" />, so <InlineMath math="i+j=4" />, even):

    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <BlockMath math="M_{13} = \det \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 6 \\ 5 & 9 \end{pmatrix} = (2 \times 9) - (6 \times 5) = 18 - 30 = -12" />
      <BlockMath math="k_{13} = (-1)^{1+3} M_{13} = (1)(-12) = -12" />
    </div>

After all cofactors are obtained, we substitute them back into the determinant formula:

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
  <BlockMath math="\det(P) = a_{11}k_{11} + a_{12}k_{12} + a_{13}k_{13}" />
  <BlockMath math="\det(P) = (1)(6) + (3)(2) + (2)(-12)" />
  <BlockMath math="\det(P) = 6 + 6 - 24" />
  <BlockMath math="\det(P) = 12 - 24" />
  <BlockMath math="\det(P) = -12" />
</div>

So, the determinant of matrix <InlineMath math="P" /> is <InlineMath math="-12" />.
