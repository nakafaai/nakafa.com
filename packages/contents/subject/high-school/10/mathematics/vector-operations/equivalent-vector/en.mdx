## Definition of Equivalent Vectors

Two vectors are said to be equivalent if they have the same magnitude (length) and direction. Mathematically, two vectors <InlineMath math="\vec{a}" /> and <InlineMath math="\vec{b}" /> are equivalent if their components are equal. In mathematical notation, this can be written as <InlineMath math="\vec{a} \equiv \vec{b}" />.

Equivalent vectors can have different positions in a plane or space, but they maintain the same magnitude and direction.

    },

## Conditions for Equivalent Vectors

Two vectors <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{CD}" /> and <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{PQ}" /> are said to be equivalent if:

1. Both vectors have equal length: <InlineMath math="|\overrightarrow{CD}| = |\overrightarrow{PQ}|" />
2. Both vectors have the same direction

## Representation of Equivalent Vectors

### In Component Form

In a two-dimensional Cartesian plane, two vectors <InlineMath math="\vec{a}" /> and <InlineMath math="\vec{b}" /> are equivalent if:

<BlockMath math="\vec{a} = (a_1, a_2) \equiv \vec{b} = (b_1, b_2)" />

where <InlineMath math="a_1 = b_1" /> and <InlineMath math="a_2 = b_2" />

In three-dimensional space, vectors <InlineMath math="\vec{a}" /> and <InlineMath math="\vec{b}" /> are equivalent if:

<BlockMath math="\vec{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3) \equiv \vec{b} = (b_1, b_2, b_3)" />

where <InlineMath math="a_1 = b_1" />, <InlineMath math="a_2 = b_2" />, and <InlineMath math="a_3 = b_3" />

    {
      from: [0, 0, 0],
      to: [2, 3, 1],
      color: getColor("FUCHSIA"),
      label: "a = (2, 3, 1)",
    },
    {
      from: [3, 0, 2],
      to: [5, 3, 3],
      color: getColor("CYAN"),
      label: "b = (2, 3, 1)",
    },
  ]}
/>

### In Terms of Initial and Terminal Points

If vector <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{AB}" /> has initial point <InlineMath math="A(x_1, y_1)" /> and terminal point <InlineMath math="B(x_2, y_2)" />, then the vector can be expressed as:

<BlockMath math="\overrightarrow{AB} = (x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1)" />

Two vectors <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{AB}" /> and <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{CD}" /> are equivalent if:

<BlockMath math="(x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1) = (x_4 - x_3, y_4 - y_3)" />

where <InlineMath math="C(x_3, y_3)" /> and <InlineMath math="D(x_4, y_4)" />

## Properties of Equivalent Vectors

### Reflexive Property

Every vector is equivalent to itself.

<BlockMath math="\vec{a} \equiv \vec{a}" />

### Symmetric Property

If vector <InlineMath math="\vec{a}" /> is equivalent to vector <InlineMath math="\vec{b}" />, then vector <InlineMath math="\vec{b}" /> is also equivalent to vector <InlineMath math="\vec{a}" />.

<BlockMath math="\text{If } \vec{a} \equiv \vec{b} \text{, then } \vec{b} \equiv \vec{a}" />

### Transitive Property

If vector <InlineMath math="\vec{a}" /> is equivalent to vector <InlineMath math="\vec{b}" /> and vector <InlineMath math="\vec{b}" /> is equivalent to vector <InlineMath math="\vec{c}" />, then vector <InlineMath math="\vec{a}" /> is equivalent to vector <InlineMath math="\vec{c}" />.

## Examples of Equivalent Vectors

### Example 1

Vector <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{AB}" /> with <InlineMath math="A(2, 3)" /> and <InlineMath math="B(5, 7)" /> is equivalent to vector <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{CD}" /> with <InlineMath math="C(1, 1)" /> and <InlineMath math="D(4, 5)" />.

Proof:

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
  <BlockMath math="\overrightarrow{AB} = (5-2, 7-3) = (3, 4)" />
  <BlockMath math="\overrightarrow{CD} = (4-1, 5-1) = (3, 4)" />
</div>

Since <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{AB} = \overrightarrow{CD} = (3, 4)" />, vector <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{AB}" /> is equivalent to vector <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{CD}" />.

    },
    {
      from: [1, 1, 0],
      to: [4, 5, 0],
      color: getColor("YELLOW"),
      label: "CD",
    },
  ]}
  cameraPosition={[10, 10, 10]}
/>

### Example 2

Vector <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{PQ}" /> with <InlineMath math="P(0, 0)" /> and <InlineMath math="Q(2, 2)" /> is equivalent to vector <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{RS}" /> with <InlineMath math="R(3, 1)" /> and <InlineMath math="S(5, 3)" />.

Proof:

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
  <BlockMath math="\overrightarrow{PQ} = (2-0, 2-0) = (2, 2)" />
  <BlockMath math="\overrightarrow{RS} = (5-3, 3-1) = (2, 2)" />
</div>

Since <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{PQ} = \overrightarrow{RS} = (2, 2)" />, vector <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{PQ}" /> is equivalent to vector <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{RS}" />.
