## Understanding Three-Dimensional Vectors

A three-dimensional vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction in three-dimensional space. Unlike two-dimensional vectors that exist only on a plane (x and y axes), three-dimensional vectors exist in space with three coordinate axes (x, y, and z axes).

## Representation of Three-Dimensional Vectors

### Notation of Three-Dimensional Vectors

Three-dimensional vectors can be notated in various ways:

1. Letter notation with an arrow above it: <InlineMath math="\vec{a}" /> or <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{PQ}" />
2. Component notation: <InlineMath math="(a_x, a_y, a_z)" /> or <InlineMath math="(a_1, a_2, a_3)" />
3. Basis notation: <InlineMath math="a_x\vec{i} + a_y\vec{j} + a_z\vec{k}" />

### Components of Three-Dimensional Vectors

A vector in three-dimensional space consists of three components that represent the projection of the vector on each coordinate axis:

<BlockMath math="\vec{a} = (a_x, a_y, a_z) = a_x\vec{i} + a_y\vec{j} + a_z\vec{k}" />

where:

- <InlineMath math="a_x" /> is the vector component on the <InlineMath math="x" />
  -axis
- <InlineMath math="a_y" /> is the vector component on the <InlineMath math="y" />
  -axis
- <InlineMath math="a_z" /> is the vector component on the <InlineMath math="z" />
  -axis
- <InlineMath math="\vec{i}, \vec{j}, \vec{k}" /> are the unit vectors on the <InlineMath math="x" />
  ,
  <InlineMath math="y" />, and <InlineMath math="z" /> axes

## Magnitude of Three-Dimensional Vectors

The magnitude or length of a three-dimensional vector <InlineMath math="\vec{a} = (a_x, a_y, a_z)" /> is determined by the formula:

<BlockMath math="|\vec{a}| = \sqrt{a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2}" />

**Example**:

If <InlineMath math="\vec{a} = (3, 4, 5)" />, then the magnitude of vector <InlineMath math="\vec{a}" /> is:

<BlockMath math="|\vec{a}| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16 + 25} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}" />

## Operations on Three-Dimensional Vectors

### Addition and Subtraction of Vectors

Addition and subtraction of three-dimensional vectors are performed by adding or subtracting the corresponding components.

If <InlineMath math="\vec{a} = (a_x, a_y, a_z)" /> and <InlineMath math="\vec{b} = (b_x, b_y, b_z)" />, then:

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
  <BlockMath math="\vec{a} + \vec{b} = (a_x + b_x, a_y + b_y, a_z + b_z)" />
  <BlockMath math="\vec{a} - \vec{b} = (a_x - b_x, a_y - b_y, a_z - b_z)" />
</div>

        label: "c = a + b",
      },
    ]}
  />
</div>

### Scalar Multiplication of Vectors

Multiplying a scalar <InlineMath math="k" /> with a vector <InlineMath math="\vec{a}" /> produces a new vector with the same direction (if <InlineMath math="k > 0" />) or opposite direction (if <InlineMath math="k < 0" />) and a magnitude <InlineMath math="|k|" /> times the magnitude of <InlineMath math="\vec{a}" />.

<BlockMath math="k\vec{a} = (k \cdot a_x, k \cdot a_y, k \cdot a_z)" />

  />
</div>

### Dot Product

The dot product between two vectors <InlineMath math="\vec{a}" /> and <InlineMath math="\vec{b}" /> produces a scalar defined as:

<BlockMath math="\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = a_x b_x + a_y b_y + a_z b_z = |\vec{a}||\vec{b}|\cos\theta" />

where <InlineMath math="\theta" /> is the angle between the two vectors.

The dot product has the following properties:

1. <InlineMath math="\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = \vec{b} \cdot \vec{a}" /> (commutative)
2. <InlineMath math="\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = 0" /> if and only if <InlineMath math="\vec{a}" /> and <InlineMath math="\vec{b}" /> are
   perpendicular (orthogonal)
3. <InlineMath math="\vec{a} \cdot \vec{a} = |\vec{a}|^2" />

### Cross Product

The cross product between two vectors <InlineMath math="\vec{a}" /> and <InlineMath math="\vec{b}" /> produces a new vector <InlineMath math="\vec{c}" /> that is perpendicular to both vectors.

<BlockMath math="\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = (a_y b_z - a_z b_y, a_z b_x - a_x b_z, a_x b_y - a_y b_x)" />

The magnitude of the cross product is:

<BlockMath math="|\vec{a} \times \vec{b}| = |\vec{a}||\vec{b}|\sin\theta" />

where <InlineMath math="\theta" /> is the angle between the two vectors.
