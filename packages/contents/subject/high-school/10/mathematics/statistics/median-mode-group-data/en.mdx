## Modal Class for Grouped Data

For grouped data, we usually don't find a specific Mode value, but instead, we focus on finding the **Modal Class**.

The **Modal Class** is the class interval that has the **highest frequency**. Simply put, just find the group with the most data points.

**Example:**

Store A's shoe size data:

| Shoe Size (Class Interval) | Frequency (<InlineMath math="f_i" />) |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| 37-39                      | 2                                     |
| 40-42                      | 11                                    |
| **43-45**                  | **16** (Highest Frequency)            |
| 46-48                      | 1                                     |
| **Total**                  | **30**                                |

Look at the frequency column. The highest frequency is **16**. The class interval with this frequency is **43-45**.

Thus, the **Modal Class** for this data is **43-45**. This means the most frequently sold shoe size is likely within this range.

## Median for Grouped Data

Finding the Median (middle value) for grouped data is a bit more complex than finding the modal class. Since the data is grouped, we need to use an estimation formula to find approximately where the middle value lies.

### How to Find the Median for Grouped Data

1.  **Calculate Median Position:**

    First, find the position of the middle data point using the formula <InlineMath math="n/2" />, where <InlineMath math="n" /> is the total number of data points.

2.  **Create Cumulative Frequency:**

    Add a column to the frequency distribution table for Cumulative Frequency (<InlineMath math="F_k" />). Cumulative frequency is the sum of frequencies from the first class up to the current class.

3.  **Determine the Median Class:**

    Find the class interval where the <InlineMath math="n/2" />-th data point lies. Look at the Cumulative Frequency column. The Median Class is the first class whose Cumulative Frequency is **equal to or greater than** <InlineMath math="n/2" />.

4.  **Use the Median Formula:**

    Once the Median Class is found, use the following formula:

    <BlockMath math="Me = L + \left( \frac{\frac{n}{2} - F}{f_{me}} \right) \times c" />

    Where:

    - <InlineMath math="Me" /> = Median of the grouped data
    - <InlineMath math="L" /> = **Lower Boundary of the Median Class**. This is the
      true lower limit of the class where the median lies. Calculated as:{" "}

      <BlockMath math="L = \text{Lower Limit of Median Class} - 0.5" />

    - <InlineMath math="n" /> = Total number of data points (total frequency)
    - <InlineMath math="F" /> = **Cumulative Frequency BEFORE** the Median Class
    - <InlineMath math="f_{me}" /> = **Frequency of the Median Class** (the frequency
      of the class containing the median)
    - <InlineMath math="c" /> = **Class Width**. This is the width of each class
      interval. Common calculation method:

      <BlockMath math="c = \text{Upper Class Boundary} - \text{Lower Class Boundary}" />

      (where <InlineMath math="\text{Upper Boundary} = \text{Upper Limit} + 0.5" />).

**Example:**

Let's use Store A's shoe size data.

| Shoe Size | Frequency (<InlineMath math="f_i" />) | Cumulative Frequency (<InlineMath math="F_k" />) |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| 37-39     | 2                                     | 2                                                |
| 40-42     | 11                                    | 2 + 11 = 13                                      |
| **43-45** | **16** (<InlineMath math="f_{me}" />) | 13 + 16 = **29**                                 |
| 46-48     | 1                                     | 29 + 1 = 30                                      |
| **Total** | **<InlineMath math="n=30" />**        |                                                  |

1.  **Median Position:** <InlineMath math="n/2 = 30/2 = 15" />. We are looking for the 15th data point.
2.  **Cumulative Frequency:** Already created in the table.
3.  **Median Class:** Look at <InlineMath math="F_k" />. Where does the 15th data point fall? The <InlineMath math="F_k" /> of the first class (2) is not enough. The <InlineMath math="F_k" /> of the second class (13) is also not enough. The <InlineMath math="F_k" /> of the third class (29) exceeds 15. So, the **Median Class is 43-45**.
4.  **Calculate Formula Components:**

    - Median Class = 43-45
    - <InlineMath math="L" /> (Lower Boundary) = <InlineMath math="43 - 0.5 = 42.5" />
    - <InlineMath math="n/2" /> = <InlineMath math="30/2 = 15" />
    - <InlineMath math="F" /> (<InlineMath math="F_k" /> before median class) =
      13
    - <InlineMath math="f_{me}" /> (Frequency of median class) = 16
    - <InlineMath math="c" /> (Class width) = Upper Boundary - Lower Boundary

      <BlockMath math="c = (45 + 0.5) - (43 - 0.5) = 45.5 - 42.5 = 3" />

5.  **Plug into the Median Formula:**

    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <BlockMath math="Me = 42.5 + \left( \frac{15 - 13}{16} \right) \times 3" />
      <BlockMath math="Me = 42.5 + \left( \frac{2}{16} \right) \times 3" />
      <BlockMath math="Me = 42.5 + \left( \frac{1}{8} \right) \times 3" />
      <BlockMath math="Me = 42.5 + \frac{3}{8}" />
      <BlockMath math="Me = 42.5 + 0.375" />
      <BlockMath math="Me = 42.875" />
    </div>

**So, the Median of the shoe size data is approximately 42.875.** This means if all the data were sorted, the middle value is estimated to be 42.875.

Remember, just like the [Mean for grouped data](/subject/high-school/10/mathematics/statistics/mean-group-data), the Median for grouped data is also an **estimation** of the true middle value.
