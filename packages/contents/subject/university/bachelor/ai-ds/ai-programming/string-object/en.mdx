## Defining String Objects

Strings in Python are ordered sequences of characters arranged neatly, like a series of letters forming words or sentences. Imagine a string like a necklace of beads where each bead represents one character.

Strings have three main characteristics you need to understand:

1. **Ordered character sequence** - each character has a fixed position
2. **Enclosed in quotes** - can be single or double quotes  
3. **Type `str`** - Python recognizes this as a string data type

<CodeBlock
  data={[
    {
      language: "python",
      filename: "string_definition.py",
      code: `# Example string with single quotes
>>> 'hello'
'hello'

# Example string with double quotes  
>>> "hello"
'hello'

# Displaying string with print
>>> print("hello")
hello

# Storing string in a variable
>>> text = 'hello'
>>> text
'hello'`
    }
  ]}
/>

Notice that when you type a string in Python, the output will always display single quotes even if you use double quotes. However, when using `print()`, the string is displayed without quotes.

## Empty Strings and str() Function

Python allows you to create empty strings and convert other data types to strings.

### Empty Strings

Empty strings are like empty containers ready to be filled with characters. You can create them with quotes containing nothing.

<CodeBlock
  data={[
    {
      language: "python",
      filename: "empty_string.py",
      code: `# Creating an empty string
>>> str = ""
>>> str
''`
    }
  ]}
/>

### str() Function

The `str()` function acts like a translator that converts various data types into string form. This is very useful when you need to convert numbers to text.

<CodeBlock
  data={[
    {
      language: "python",
      filename: "str_function.py",
      code: `# Converting number to string
>>> str(5)
'5'

# Converting float to string
>>> xstr = str(3.4)
>>> print(xstr)
3.4`
    }
  ]}
/>

## Multi-line Strings

When you need to write long text or text consisting of multiple lines, Python provides several ways to handle it.

### Line Continuation Character

You can use the backslash (`\`) character to continue a string to the next line. This is useful when a string is too long for one line.

<CodeBlock
  data={[
    {
      language: "python",
      filename: "line_continuation.py",
      code: `# Using backslash for line continuation
>>> text = 'xxx' \
...: 'yyy'

>>> text
'xxxyyy'

>>> print(text)
xxxyyy`
    }
  ]}
/>

### Line Continuation with Parentheses

Another alternative is using parentheses to group multi-line strings. This method is often more readable.

<CodeBlock
  data={[
    {
      language: "python",
      filename: "parentheses_continuation.py",
      code: `# Using parentheses for line continuation
>>> text = ('xxx'
...: 'yyy')

>>> text
'xxxyyy'

>>> print(text)
xxxyyy`
    }
  ]}
/>

### Triple Quotes

Triple quotes (three quote marks) allow you to write strings that are truly multi-line with actual line breaks.

<CodeBlock
  data={[
    {
      language: "python",
      filename: "triple_quotes.py",
      code: `# Triple single quotes
>>> text = '''xxx
...: yyy
...: zzz'''

>>> text
'xxx\\nyyy\\nzzz'

>>> print(text)
xxx
yyy
zzz`
    }
  ]}
/>

Triple double quotes work the same way as triple single quotes, providing flexibility in quote selection.

## String Literal Concatenation

Python provides several ways to combine strings, both literals and variables.

### Adjacent Literal Concatenation

When you place string literals next to each other without operators, Python will automatically combine them. This is like joining two words without needing glue.

<CodeBlock
  data={[
    {
      language: "python",
      filename: "literal_concatenation.py",
      code: `# Adjacent string literals are automatically combined
>>> 'hello ' 'world'
'hello world'

# Combining multiple strings at once
>>> "hel" 'lo' " world" '!'
'hello world!'`
    }
  ]}
/>

### Plus Operator (+)

The plus operator functions like glue that combines strings into one unit.

<CodeBlock
  data={[
    {
      language: "python",
      filename: "plus_operator.py",
      code: `# Using + operator for concatenation
>>> 'hello ' + 'world'
'hello world'`
    }
  ]}
/>

### Multiplication Operator (*)

The multiplication operator allows you to repeat a string as many times as desired, like copying text multiple times.

<CodeBlock
  data={[
    {
      language: "python",
      filename: "multiplication_operator.py",
      code: `# Repeating string with * operator
>>> 3 * '+o+'
'+o++o++o+'`
    }
  ]}
/>

## String Variable Concatenation

When working with string variables, there are special rules you need to understand.

### Using Operators

To combine strings stored in variables, you must use the `+` or `*` operators. Unlike string literals, variables cannot be combined just by placing them adjacent to each other.

<CodeBlock
  data={[
    {
      language: "python",
      filename: "variable_concatenation.py",
      code: `# Defining string variables
>>> text1 = 'hello'
>>> text2 = 'world!'
>>> text3 = '+o+'
>>> a = 3

# Combining with + operator
>>> text1 + ' world'
'hello world!'

>>> 'hello ' + text2
'hello world!'

>>> text1 + ' ' + text2
'hello world!'

# Repeating with * operator
>>> a * text3
'+o++o++o+'

>>> text3 * a
'+o++o++o+'`
    }
  ]}
/>

### Common Errors

It's important to understand that placing string variables adjacent without operators will cause syntax errors.

<CodeBlock
  data={[
    {
      language: "python",
      filename: "concatenation_errors.py",
      code: `# ERROR: Cannot combine variables without operators
>>> text1 'world'
SyntaxError ...

>>> 'hello ' text2
SyntaxError ...

>>> text1 text2
SyntaxError ...`
    }
  ]}
