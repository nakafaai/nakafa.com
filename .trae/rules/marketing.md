# Marketing Guidelines

## LinkedIn Marketing Strategy

### 1. Condense Time for Your Audience

Things humans can't resist:

- Cheat codes
- Big payoffs for little work
- Skipping to the front of the line

**Principle:** "Do the work so they don't have to."

**Example:**
> "I spent 100 hours learning X so you don't have to. I'll teach you in 5 minutes."

### 2. Create "Bookmark Bait"

Give step-by-step breakdowns. When you take someone from point A to point B, two important things happen:

1. **You earn trust at scale** (helps you convert).
2. **Lazy people bookmark it for later** (juices the algorithm).

**Goal:** Exploit the algorithm, help people.

### 3. Viral Formula: Social Proof + Emotion

If you could give just one tip about going viral, it’s this: **Write a hook that answers 2 basic questions:**

- What emotion are you targeting?
- Why should they trust you?

**Note:** Hooks are 80% of your success. (Recommended tool: `http://Kleo.so` for writing hooks).

### 4. Make People Feel Smart

People love feeling intelligent, but hate doing work. Simplify a complex topic and they will love you.

**Strategy:** Turn a complex process (e.g., getting SEO traffic) into a simple, linear game.

### 5. Visualize Boring Data with Fun Diagrams

This works especially well if it is first-party data. If it also tells a story, it’s guaranteed to go viral.

### 6. Give People "Dinner Table" Sound Bites

The "dinner table" in a professional context is:

- Slack
- Sales calls
- Team calls

**Goal:** Make people sound smart at these 3 "dinner tables". Provide concise, shareable insights they can repeat to their colleagues.
