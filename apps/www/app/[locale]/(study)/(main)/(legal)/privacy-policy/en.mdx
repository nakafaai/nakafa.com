Last updated: January 25, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how PT. Nakafa Tekno Kreatif ("Nakafa," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses Personal Data when you access or use our websites, applications, and related services (collectively, the "Services").

Your use of the Services is at all times subject to our [Terms of Service](/en/terms-of-service), which incorporates this Privacy Policy.

## What this Privacy Policy covers

This Privacy Policy covers how we treat Personal Data that we gather when you access or use the Services.

This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of companies we do not own or control, or people we do not manage, including third-party services you may access through the Services.

## Key definitions

- User Content means information you submit through the Services, such as chat messages, comments, and other text you provide.
- Service Providers means vendors and service providers that process Personal Data on our behalf.

## Personal Data we collect

The table below summarizes categories of Personal Data we collect, why we collect it, and the categories of third parties with whom we disclose it. Details are explained in the sections that follow.

| Category of Personal Data (examples) | Purpose(s) for collection | Categories of third parties with whom we disclose |

## Why we collect and use Personal Data

We collect and use Personal Data to operate, maintain, and improve the Services. This includes providing account and learning features, supporting subscriptions, communicating with you (including transactional emails), measuring service performance, preventing abuse and scraping, and complying with legal obligations.

### Legal bases for processing (GDPR)

If you are in the EU/EEA, we process Personal Data under one or more of the following legal bases:

- Contract: processing is necessary to provide the Services you request.
- Legitimate interests: processing is necessary for security, service improvement, and fraud prevention, and those interests are not overridden by your rights.
- Consent: where required, for example for certain analytics or marketing choices if applicable.
- Legal obligation: processing is necessary to comply with applicable laws.

## Where Personal Data comes from

- From you directly, when you create an account, submit User Content, or contact us.
- Automatically, when you use the Services (for example device, usage, and analytics events).
- From third parties you interact with through the Services, such as Polar payment events and Resend email delivery events.

## How we disclose Personal Data

We disclose Personal Data in the following circumstances:

- Service Providers: we use Service Providers to host and operate the Services, store data, deliver emails, and process payments and analytics. These include Vercel (hosting), Convex (database/backend), PostHog (analytics), Vercel Analytics (analytics), Resend (email delivery), and Polar (payments/subscriptions).
- AI processing: when you submit prompts or chat messages for AI features, we send that input to Vercel AI Gateway for processing, and we receive the model output back to provide the feature.
- Legal and safety: we may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to comply with law, respond to lawful requests, protect rights and safety, or investigate fraud or abuse.
- Business transfers: if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

## AI processing and Vercel AI Gateway

If you use AI features, your prompts and related context are processed through Vercel AI Gateway. The underlying model provider depends on the model selected and the gateway configuration.

Do not include sensitive personal data in prompts (for example government IDs, financial account numbers, or highly sensitive health information). You are responsible for the content you submit.

For more information about Vercel AI Gateway terms, please review Vercel’s AI Product Terms for AI Gateway at [Vercel AI Product Terms](https://vercel.com/legal/ai-product-terms#ai-gateway).

## Tracking technologies and analytics

We use analytics tools to understand how users interact with the Services and to improve performance and reliability. These tools use cookies and similar technologies (such as local storage) to recognize your browser/device and collect usage events.

Our current analytics providers include:

- PostHog (product analytics)
- Vercel Analytics (website and product analytics)

### Your choices

- Browser controls: most browsers allow you to control cookies through settings, including blocking or deleting cookies.
- Device settings: your device may allow you to control certain identifiers and tracking behaviors.
- Do Not Track: some browsers offer a "Do Not Track" setting. There is no uniform industry standard for responding to Do Not Track signals; we treat it as a preference signal but may still collect analytics needed to operate the Services.

Blocking cookies may affect certain features, such as login sessions and preferences.

## Data retention

We retain Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide the Services and for legitimate business purposes, including compliance, dispute resolution, and enforcement of agreements.

Retention depends on the type of data:

- Account and profile data is retained while your account is active and for a reasonable period after deletion to complete deletion workflows, prevent fraud, and comply with legal requirements.
- Subscription and billing records are retained as required for accounting, tax, and compliance.
- Security and audit-related data may be retained to investigate abuse and protect the Services.

If you request deletion, we will delete or de-identify Personal Data unless we are required or permitted to retain it for legal or legitimate business reasons.

## Data security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, alteration, and destruction.

No security program can eliminate all risk. You are responsible for keeping your account credentials confidential and for using a secure password and device practices.

## International data transfers

We are based in Indonesia and may process and store Personal Data in Indonesia and other countries where our Service Providers operate. When we transfer Personal Data across borders, we take steps designed to provide appropriate safeguards as required by applicable law.

## Children’s privacy

The Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13, do not use the Services or submit Personal Data.

If you are under 18, you may use the Services only with the involvement and permission of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.

If we learn that we collected Personal Data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information.

## Your privacy rights
