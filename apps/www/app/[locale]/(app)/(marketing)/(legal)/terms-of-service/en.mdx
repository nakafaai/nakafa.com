## AI features

### How AI features work

If you use AI features, you submit prompts or messages and the Services generate outputs. Prompts and related context are processed through Vercel AI Gateway, and the underlying model provider depends on the model selected.

For more information about Vercel AI Gateway terms, review [Vercel AI Product Terms](https://vercel.com/legal/ai-product-terms#ai-gateway).

### AI limitations and your responsibility

AI outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate. You are responsible for verifying any output before relying on it, including in educational, professional, medical, legal, or financial contexts.

Do not include sensitive personal data in prompts (for example government IDs or payment card numbers). You are responsible for the content you submit.

## Subscriptions and payments

Certain features may require a paid Subscription.

Subscriptions are managed through Polar. When you start or manage a Subscription, you are redirected to Polar checkout and/or a Polar customer portal.

You authorize us and Polar to charge the payment method associated with your Polar account for Subscription fees, including applicable taxes, and you authorize renewal charges until you cancel.

### Renewal and cancellation

Unless otherwise stated at checkout, Subscriptions renew automatically until canceled. You can cancel through the customer portal provided via the Services.

If you cancel, access to paid features continues until the end of the current billing period, unless otherwise stated at checkout.

### Fees and refunds

All fees are non-refundable except where required by applicable law or explicitly stated at checkout or in a written offer by Nakafa.

We may change pricing or plans over time. If changes apply to your Subscription, we will provide notice through the Services or by email, and the change will apply no earlier than your next renewal, unless otherwise required by law.

## Emails and communications

We send transactional emails related to the Services, such as a welcome email, security notices, and important service updates. We use an email delivery provider (Resend) to send these emails.

If we send optional promotional communications, you can opt out by using the unsubscribe link in the message or by contacting us.

## Intellectual property

The Services, including our content, software, design, and trademarks, are owned by Nakafa or our licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Services or included content unless you have our prior written permission or such activity is permitted by law.

## User Content

You retain your rights in User Content you submit.

By submitting User Content, you grant Nakafa a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, reproduce, display, and process your User Content solely to operate, improve, and provide the Services, including processing prompts to generate AI outputs.

You represent that you have the rights necessary to submit User Content and that your User Content does not violate applicable law or the rights of others.

## Third-party services

- Vercel (hosting)
- Convex (database and backend infrastructure)
- Polar (payments and subscription management)
- PostHog and Vercel Analytics (analytics)
- Resend (email delivery)
- Vercel AI Gateway (AI request routing)

Your use of third-party services may also be subject to their terms and policies. We are not responsible for third-party services.

## Disclaimers

The Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

## Limitation of liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Nakafa will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenues, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising out of or related to your use of the Services.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Nakafa’s total liability for any claims arising out of or relating to the Services will not exceed the greater of (a) the amount you paid us for the Services in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim, or (b) USD $100 (or the equivalent in your local currency).

This limitation does not apply to liability that cannot be limited under applicable law.

## Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Nakafa and its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Services, your User Content, or your violation of these Terms.

## Termination

You may stop using the Services at any time.

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services if we believe you violated these Terms, if required to comply with law, or if your use creates risk or harm to the Services, other users, or third parties.

Upon termination, your right to use the Services will stop immediately. Provisions that by their nature should survive termination will survive, including intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnity, and dispute resolution.

## Governing law and dispute resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of Indonesia, without regard to conflict of law principles.

Except where prohibited by applicable law, you and Nakafa agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought exclusively in the courts of the Republic of Indonesia, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

## Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice through the Services, by email, or by other reasonable means.

Your continued use of the Services after the updated Terms become effective means you accept the updated Terms.
