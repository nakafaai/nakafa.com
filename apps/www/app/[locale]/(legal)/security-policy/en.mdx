# Security Policy

_Last Updated: October 18, 2025_

## 1. Introduction

This Security Policy outlines the measures we take to protect the security of our platform and your data. At Nakafa, we are committed to ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and the information entrusted to us.

## 2. Data Security

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. These measures include:

- **Encryption:** All data transmitted between your browser and our servers is encrypted using SSL/TLS. Data at rest is also encrypted to protect it from unauthorized access.
- **Access Control:** Access to personal information is strictly limited to employees who need it to perform their job functions. We use the principle of least privilege to ensure that individuals only have access to the data necessary for their roles.
- **Secure Infrastructure:** Our platform is hosted on Vercel, which provides a secure and resilient infrastructure. Our database is managed by Convex, which offers robust security features to protect your data.

## 3. Vulnerability Management

We regularly scan our systems for vulnerabilities and apply patches in a timely manner. We also encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities by security researchers. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our platform, please contact us at [nakafaai@gmail.com](mailto:nakafaai@gmail.com).

## 4. Incident Response

In the event of a security breach, we have an incident response plan in place to promptly address the issue. Our plan includes steps to contain the breach, assess the impact, and notify affected users as required by law.

## 5. Employee Training

All our employees receive regular security training to ensure they are aware of the latest threats and best practices for protecting user data. This training covers topics such as phishing, social engineering, and secure coding practices.

## 6. Policy Updates

We may update this Security Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our security practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy on our platform.
