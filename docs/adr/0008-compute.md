# ADR 0008: Admit And Bound Paid Work

## Decision

Convex reserves a chat turn's model credits in the same transaction that creates
its hold and usage ledger entry. Provider generation starts only after that
transaction commits. Concurrent requests cannot spend the same balance. A native
Convex token bucket independently limits admission to a burst of five starts and
ten starts per minute per user, including requests whose credits are refunded.

Successful persistence closes the hold and completes its existing ledger entry.
Failure refunds it at most once. A refund can restore only the allowance from
which the hold was taken: both the reset timestamp and the plan grant identity
must still match. Upgrades, downgrades, account deletion, and calendar resets
cannot turn an old hold into extra credits. An abandoned hold expires after ten
minutes, beyond the HTTP function's five-minute maximum. The native scheduled
recovery is intentionally retained even when it becomes an idempotent no-op.

The HTTP request owns one work deadline with time left for durable persistence.
Request cancellation and reader cancellation propagate through the main AI SDK
stream, specialist agents, tool repair, suggestions, and abortable HTTP clients.
The failure adapter registers Vercel `waitUntil` immediately and waits for local
generation settlement before returning credits. An optional suggestion timeout
must not discard an already completed main answer. External services remain
responsible for stopping work after cancellation; each remote calculation also
has its own execution limit.

CAS runs each calculation in the owned Python worker process. A twenty-second
deadline kills and reaps that worker. Two local slots reject excess work instead
of creating a waiting queue. Request, operand, collection, matrix, derivative,
and serialized-result limits bound input and output. Linux workers additionally
limit address space to 512 MiB because small symbolic inputs can allocate large
intermediate integers. This leaves headroom in the verified standard 2 GiB
production instance. Process startup adds latency, so normal arithmetic,
calculus, and matrix results are part of worker acceptance.

## Convex Ownership

Popularity counter operations own their Aggregate insert, replace, and delete in
the same Convex transaction. Updates reuse the document already read for the
counter calculation. There is no second trigger facade. The transaction rolls
back both changes if either write fails. Read-only ranking consumers keep the
same Aggregate contract.

Mutations that write only tables without registered triggers use native Convex
builders. Mutations that own message, subscription, score, or other registered
trigger invariants keep trigger-aware builders. Explicit table IDs alone are
not a cost optimization: the installed trigger writer can read old and new rows
even for unregistered tables. Verify complete write ownership before changing a
builder, and preserve the measured database-read budgets.

Active Pro plan lookup reads one indexed matching subscription. Try-out access
separately enforces a live period through the existing end-date index. Polar
ingestion normalizes dates with `toISOString()`, and the current production rows
were verified before using the lexicographic date range. IRT lookup selects
current records inside the index rather than filtering historical rows after
reading them. Prefix indexes remain when their implicit creation-time ordering
is part of a consumer's contract.

## Rollout

This release expands assistant persistence with an optional hold while the
previous HTTP server can still finish requests. The release owner switches the
production server, observes the old server's maximum request lifetime and
scheduled persistence, then removes the unreserved persistence path in the
cleanup release. Do not retain that path as a permanent compatibility API.
