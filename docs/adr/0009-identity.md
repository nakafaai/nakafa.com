# ADR 0009: Token-Verified Reads And Session-Validated Writes

## Decision

The session middleware resolves one caller identity per Convex function and
provides it as `Session`: the Better Auth user id and the matching app user.
How it gets the Better Auth user id depends on the function type.

- Queries read the identity Convex already verified from the Better Auth token
  (`Auth.getUserIdentity`) and look up the app user by its `authId` index. They
  never call the Better Auth component.
- For mutations and actions the middleware also confirms, before they write,
  that the token's session still exists, has not expired and belongs to the
  token's user, and that the user still exists. One read answers this:
  `session.live`, a query of the Better Auth component that reads the two rows
  by their ids and imports no Better Auth code. A verified token that does not
  name its session fails the write with `AuthReadError`: Better Auth puts the
  session in every token it issues, so the claim is never simply absent.
- `prepareCurrentAccountDeletion` runs without the middleware and reads the
  signed-in Better Auth user through the adapter (`getAuthUser`), as it did
  before.

`getCurrentUser` projects the account profile (name, email, image) from the app
user row. Better Auth's user triggers and the rename mutation keep those fields
current in the same transaction as the Better Auth write.

## Consequences

- A revoked or signed-out session can still read for the rest of its token's
  lifetime, which the Convex plugin sets to 15 minutes. Writes stop at once.
- Signed-in queries skip the Better Auth component. Production measured
  `getCurrentUser` at about one second at the median while it asked Better Auth
  through `safeGetAuthUser`, and every signed-in page waits on it before
  identity settles.
- A write pays one small component read. `safeGetAuthUser` answered the same
  question with two lookups through Better Auth's adapter. Measured on 12
  October 2026: the adapter's module bundles to 2,830 KiB in 1,438 modules and
  `session.live` to 56 KiB in 33 (the Convex CLI's bundler options); production
  ran one adapter lookup in 327 to 615 ms, and `nina/turns:start`, which reads
  23 rows, took 1,034 to 1,201 ms with two of them.
- Account state that must take effect immediately for reads, such as deletion,
  lives on the app user row, which every query reads.

## Stored Secrets

Better Auth seals the provider access and refresh tokens in `account`
(`account.encryptOAuthTokens`) and the private half of each signing key in
`jwks`, also in the static `JWKS` value, with the Better Auth secret. It stores
the Google ID token and the session token as issued. The ID token signs no one
in, because Google ID token sign-in is off (`disableIdTokenSignIn`). The session
token does: the bearer hook that the Convex plugin installs accepts it in an
`Authorization` header, and Better Auth has no option to seal it. Rotating the
secret signs every learner out. List the new secret first in
`BETTER_AUTH_SECRETS`, keep `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` at its old value, and keep each
older version listed while anything is still sealed with it. Keep
`encryptOAuthTokens` on, because with it off Better Auth hands out the cipher
text.

## Rejected Alternatives

Validating the session inside every query closes the read window after
revocation, but it adds a Better Auth component read to every signed-in read to
protect a credential that is already short-lived and that the client discards
on sign-out.

Confirming a write through `safeGetAuthUser` gives the same answer as
`session.live` for a token Better Auth issued, at the cost above. It also does
not compare the session's user with the token's, which `session.live` does.
