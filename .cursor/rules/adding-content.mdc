# Adding Content to Nakafa

To add new educational content:

1. Navigate to the appropriate level in [packages/contents/subject/](mdc:packages/contents/subject/)
2. Create MDX files following the existing structure
   - For articles: [packages/contents/articles/](mdc:packages/contents/articles/)
   - For subjects: Create in relevant grade/material directory
3. Update data files in `_data/` directories (e.g., subject.ts)
4. Test locally with `bun dev`

## Content Structure

- MDX files should include frontmatter with title, description, etc.
- Use components from [packages/design-system/](mdc:packages/design-system/) for interactive elements.
- Support both English (en.mdx) and Indonesian (id.mdx) versions.
- Add references in ref.ts if needed.

Ensure content is educational, accurate, and follows the AGPL-3.0 license.
