## Basic Operation Properties

Addition and scalar multiplication operations on complex numbers have interesting properties, similar to those of real numbers. These properties help us in performing calculations.

Let <InlineMath math="z_1" />, <InlineMath math="z_2" />, and <InlineMath math="z_3" /> be any complex numbers, and let <InlineMath math="c" /> and <InlineMath math="d" /> be any scalars (real numbers).

## Properties Related to Addition

### Commutativity

The order of addition does not matter; the result remains the same.

<BlockMath math="z_1 + z_2 = z_2 + z_1" />

Example: <InlineMath math="(2+i) + (1-3i) = (1-3i) + (2+i) = 3-2i" />

### Associativity

When adding three complex numbers, the grouping of the addition does not affect the result.

<BlockMath math="(z_1 + z_2) + z_3 = z_1 + (z_2 + z_3)" />

### Additive Identity (Zero Element)

There exists a complex number <InlineMath math="0 = 0 + 0i" /> (zero) such that when added to any complex number <InlineMath math="z_1" />, the result is <InlineMath math="z_1" /> itself.

<BlockMath math="z_1 + 0 = z_1" />

### Additive Inverse (Opposite)

Every complex number <InlineMath math="z_1 = x + iy" /> has an additive inverse (opposite), denoted by <InlineMath math="-z_1 = -x - iy" />, such that their sum is the zero element (0).

<BlockMath math="z_1 + (-z_1) = 0" />

Example:

If <InlineMath math="z_1 = 5-2i" />, then <InlineMath math="-z_1 = -5+2i" />.

Then <InlineMath math="(5-2i) + (-5+2i) = (5-5) + i(-2+2) = 0 + 0i = 0" />.

## Properties Related to Scalar Multiplication and Addition

### Associativity of Scalar Multiplication

The grouping of scalar multiplication does not affect the result.

<BlockMath math="c(dz_1) = (cd)z_1" />

### Distributivity of Scalar over Scalar Addition

A scalar can be distributed over the addition of scalars.

<BlockMath math="(c + d)z_1 = cz_1 + dz_1" />

### Distributivity of Scalar over Complex Addition

A scalar can be distributed over the addition of complex numbers.

<BlockMath math="c(z_1 + z_2) = cz_1 + cz_2" />

### Scalar Multiplicative Identity

Multiplying a complex number by the scalar 1 does not change the complex number.

<BlockMath math="1 z_1 = z_1" />

### Multiplication by Zero Scalar

Multiplying a complex number by the scalar 0 results in the complex number zero.

<BlockMath math="0 z_1 = 0" />

## Using the Operation Properties

These properties can be used to simplify or prove expressions involving complex numbers.

### Example of Using Properties

Show that for any complex number <InlineMath math="z" />, <InlineMath math="4z + (-4)z = 0" /> holds.

**Solution:**

We can use the distributivity of scalar over scalar addition (property f) and the multiplication by zero scalar property (property i).

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
  <BlockMath math="4z + (-4)z = (4 + (-4))z \quad \text{(Distributive Property)}" />
  <BlockMath math="= (0)z \quad \text{(Scalar addition)}" />
  <BlockMath math="= 0 \quad \text{(Multiplication by Zero Scalar Property)}" />
</div>

Thus, it is proven that <InlineMath math="4z + (-4)z = 0" />.

## Exercise

Using the properties above, prove that <InlineMath math="3z - \frac{1}{2}(2z) = 2z" /> for any complex number <InlineMath math="z" />.

### Answer Key

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
  <BlockMath math="3z - \frac{1}{2}(2z) = 3z + (-\frac{1}{2})(2z) \quad \text{(Definition of subtraction)}" />
  <BlockMath math="= 3z + ((-\frac{1}{2}) \times 2)z \quad \text{(Associativity of Scalar Multiplication)}" />
  <BlockMath math="= 3z + (-1)z \quad \text{(Scalar multiplication)}" />
  <BlockMath math="= (3 + (-1))z \quad \text{(Distributive Property)}" />
  <BlockMath math="= (2)z \quad \text{(Scalar addition)}" />
  <BlockMath math="= 2z" />
</div>

Thus, it is proven that <InlineMath math="3z - \frac{1}{2}(2z) = 2z" />.
