## Why Naming Triangle Sides Is Important?

In trigonometry, the three sides of a right triangle have special names. This naming system allows us to calculate distances or heights of objects that are difficult to measure directly, such as skyscrapers, tall trees, or even mountains!

Imagine you want to know the height of a tower without having to climb it. With trigonometry and an understanding of the sides of a right triangle, you can calculate it by simply measuring the distance and angle from where you're standing.

## Three Names of Sides in a Right Triangle

In a right triangle, the naming of sides is always related to the angle we're focusing on (apart from the right angle). For example, if we're focusing on angle <InlineMath math="\theta" />, then the three sides have the following names:

1. **Opposite Side** - The side directly across from angle <InlineMath math="\theta" /> that we're focusing on. This side "faces" the angle directly.

2. **Adjacent Side** - The side adjacent to angle <InlineMath math="\theta" />. This side is one of the sides that forms angle <InlineMath math="\theta" />, but it's not the hypotenuse.

3. **Hypotenuse** - The longest side in a right triangle and always opposite to the right angle (<InlineMath math="90^\circ" />). This side connects the two furthest points in the triangle.

    labels={{
      opposite: "Opposite Side",
      adjacent: "Adjacent Side",
      hypotenuse: "Hypotenuse",
    }}
  />
</div>

## The Importance of Understanding the Naming

Understanding the naming of right triangle sides is a very important first step in learning trigonometry. These names will form the basis for trigonometric formulas such as sine, cosine, and tangent.

Remember, the naming of right triangle sides is always relative to the angle we're focusing on. If the angle we're focusing on changes, the names of the sides will also change!
